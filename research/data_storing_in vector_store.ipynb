With the Indian Government’s promise to improve the ease of doing business and its ‘Make in India’ or ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ (for a self-reliant India) initiative, comes the obligation to ensure that the rule of law is upheld and contracts are e\\x00ciently enforced. The G o v e r n m e n t r e c o g n i z e s t h e correspondent obligation that the Indian legal regime and judiciary must facilitate and support the litigation process. This includes a streamlined process for the enforcement of contracts, as well as domestic and foreign judgments, and arbitral awards in a timely and e\\x00cient manner.\\n\\nDespite India becoming a heavy contributor to the global economy, it su\\x00ers the drawback of an overburdened judiciary, with an ever-increasing caseload. The consequent delay in the judicial process has contributed to the perception that it is di\\x00cult to successfully prosecute a claim or enforce a judgment or arbitral award in India. E\\x00orts to improve the process in the last few years include major amendments to the Indian arbitration regime, the setting up of commercial courts and divisions to adjudicate ‘Commercial Disputes’ of ‘Specified Value’, and matters connected therewith, including incidental amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.\\n\\n6 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nOther notable reforms include the repeal of the Companies Act, 1956 with the introduction of the Companies Act, 2013 (“Companies Act”). This also brought along with it a complete overhaul of the liquidation and bankruptcy process with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (the “IBC”), consolidating various legislations which deal with insolvency of individuals, partnerships and limited liability partnerships into one single legislation thereby making the process more streamlined and e\\x00cient. Jurisdiction for matters under the IBC has been exclusively conferred on the National Company Law Tribunal (the “NCLT”), thus relieving the burden on High Courts and providing redressal to financial and operational creditors in relation to non-performing assets.\\n\\nRecognising that the Government is the most prolific litigant before Indian courts, in a bid to improve the judicial landscape and make India an attractive investment destination, the Government introduced the Vivad se Vishwas II (Contractual Disputes) scheme for the settlement of disputes involving government entities. It applies to disputes where the claim was raised on or before September 30, 2022 and includes cases at di\\x00erent stages of proceedings, from the time of invocation of an arbitration to pending challenges to arbitral awards. Depending on the stage of the dispute / legal proceeding, a\\n\\npercentage is ascribed for the settlement of a claim made by private entities against the government and / or government / public entities. It is hoped that the Vivad se Vishwas II scheme will help free up government funds which would otherwise likely be tied up for decades in litigation, whilst aiding private companies / individuals in recovery of awarded amounts, and easing the caseload in courts – a testament to the Government’s intent once again, to ensure an e\\x00cient determination of disputes.\\n\\nBuilding on the path of liberalisation, with the backing of the Government, in March 2023 the Bar Council of India notified rules permitting the entry of foreign lawyers in India, entitling them to practice in specified “non-litigious” areas once they are registered under the Rules. Foreign lawyers and firms can also continue to practice on a fly in, fly out basis as permitted earlier.\\n\\nThese reforms go towards cementing India’s position as a commercial hub, optimising it as a destination for investment, business and arbitration. Underpinning these reforms therefore is the unceasing e\\x00ort to make access to justice easier and reduce the concerns of foreign investors and trading partners.\\n\\nDoing business in a foreign country can be fraught with uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. The support of a\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nrobust legal regime and familiarisation with the process can lessen such unpredictability. These reforms and an overview of the dispute resolution process in India – with a focus on litigation is further discussed in the relevant chapters of this Guide / Handbook, which we present to our readers in the hope that this will give them a reasonable understanding of the process.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All information given in this handbook has been compiled from credible, reliable sources.

LITIGATION IN CIVIL COURTS\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n01\\n\\nIndia – A Common Law System\\n\\nIndia is primarily a common law jurisdiction. There are certain personal laws based on customary practice that are applicable to some religious communities. Indian law is largely similar to English common law in many aspects because of the long period of British colonial influence during the British Raj period. Indeed, several legislations were framed by the British based on their own laws, some of which continue to this day, for example, contract law, penal laws, evidence, general civil procedure etc. Some laws that operate on personal / familial relationships, are based on custom or religion of individuals covered thereby, typically in relation to marriage and succession.\\n\\nIn India, the common law system, which is based on the principle that it is unfair to treat similar facts di\\x00erently on di\\x00erent occasions, earlier decided cases are treated as binding precedents on lower courts and of persuasive value in courts with the same or superior jurisdiction. There are several pieces of legislation that were enacted pre-independence by the Imperial Legislative Council, such as: the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (“IPC”), the Indian Contract Act 1872, the Evidence Act 1872, etc.\\n\\nThe Constitution of India, 1950 adopts a quasi-federal structure. The 7th Schedule allocates subjects between the Parliament and the state legislatures into\\n\\n10 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\n3 lists (i.e. Union, State and Concurrent Lists).\\n\\nThe Parliament, the apex legislative body, consists of 2 houses and is empowered to enact laws on subjects in the Union List. The state legislatures are empowered to enact laws on subjects in the State List. Both the Parliament and the state legislatures may enact laws on subjects mentioned in the Concurrent list but in case of a conflict, the law enacted by the Parliament prevails. Laws enacted by the Parliament and the state legislatures are binding, as also, laws pronounced by the Supreme Court (by way of judicial pronouncements).\\n\\nLaws enacted by the Parliament are published in the Gazette of India, whereas laws enacted by the state legislatures are published in their respective state gazettes. The Parliament as well as the state legislatures are empowered to enact legislation having retrospective e\\x00ect, apart from criminal legislation. Laws are generally applicable prospectively, unless specifically mentioned otherwise.\\n\\nIndian court proceedings are adversarial, i.e. where parties present their case before a judge who must remain impartial and refrain from acting as an inquisitor (as he may in a civil law jurisdiction). The court may, to e\\x00ectively rule on an issue (on matters of both law\\n\\nand fact), put questions to a witness, or direct parties to lead evidence on certain aspects. In the late 1960s, India abolished the jury system for civil and criminal proceedings, except for matrimonial disputes relating to the ‘Parsi’ community.\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nCivil courts in India are governed by the procedure set out in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (“CPC”). Criminal o\\x00ences are covered by the IPC, and criminal courts are governed by the procedure set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“CrPC”).\\n\\n11 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n02\\n\\nIndia’s Judicial System\\n\\nThe Indian Constitution is federal in form but quasi-federal in spirit - the Constitution is supreme and there is a division of power between the Union and States i.e. the Constitution provides for a union list, state list and a concurrent list. The judiciary is wholly independent of the legislature and executive, and historically, has been a very activist judiciary.\\n\\nIndia\\'s judicial system is broken up into three distinct streams, i.e. criminal, civil cases and other cases which may be referred to specific statutorily constituted courts and tribunals depending on subject matter and the status concerned. Jurisdiction of a court is dependent on its territorial and pecuniary limits and may also be circumscribed by subject matter. Some courts or tribunals are conferred with exclusive\\n\\n12 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\njurisdiction over matters and disputes of a particular subject matter.\\n\\nThe principal court of original jurisdiction is the City Civil Court (in metropolitan areas) and the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division (in non- metropolitan areas). There are 25 High Courts covering the 28 States and 8 Union Territories of India. The High Court is the court of appeal and has supervisory jurisdiction over all lower courts and tribunals in the State / Union Territory over which it has territorial jurisdiction. The High Courts of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras and Himachal Pradesh, also have original jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of India has overall superintendence over all High Courts and lower courts and tribunals in India, and is the final court of appeal.\\n\\nSupreme Court:\\n\\nUnder the Constitution of India, the role of the Supreme Court is that of a federal court, guardian of the Constitution and the highest / final court of appeal, having overall supervisory jurisdiction over State High Courts and all lower courts and tribunals in India. The Supreme Court is established under Article 124 of the Constitution and has a sanctioned strength of 34 judges who can sit singly or in benches of 2 or more judges. Matters involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution are heard by larger benches comprising 5 or more judges (up to even 13 judges).\\n\\nIn its original writ jurisdiction, the Supreme Court is empowered to enforce fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution by issuing directions, orders, or writs (including writs in the nature of h a b e a s c o r p u s , m a n d a m u s , prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari). It may also adjudicate upon disputes between the Union and one or more States, or a dispute, inter se, between two or more States, where the dispute involves any question (whether of law, or of fact), on which the existence, or extent of a legal right depends.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court is also empowered to transfer any civil or criminal cases from one High Court to another, if\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nsatisfied that they involve similar questions of law. If it believes that such questions are of substantial general importance, the Supreme Court may withdraw a case from the High Court or High Courts to entertain and dispose of such case, itself.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction can be invoked in respect of any judgment, decree, or final order of a High Court (in both civil and criminal cases). Invocation of its appellate jurisdiction is on the basis of a certificate from the High Court concerned that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, or of general importance which needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. In criminal cases, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court if the High Court has reversed an order of acquittal and sentenced a person to death, or imprisonment for at least 10 years, or certified that the case is fit for appeal to the Supreme Court. The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can also be invoked from the decisions of some tribunals, for instance, the NCLAT and the SAT.\\n\\nIn fit cases, on important issues of law, the Supreme Court may be approached for special leave to appeal, against any judgment, or order of any court in India (not including a court constituted by, or under any law relating to the Armed\\n\\n13 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nForces), including in respect of one against which there is no statutory right of appeal.\\n\\nHigh Courts:\\n\\nThe High Court is the supreme judicial authority at the State level and generally the last court of regular appeals. Judges in the High Court, either sit singly, or in benches of two or more judges. There are currently 25 High Courts in the country (the oldest being the Calcutta High Court), established under Article 214 of the Constitution of India.\\n\\nThe Constitution confers on every H i g h C o u r t t h e p o w e r o f superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction (except those constituted by any law relating to the armed forces).\\n\\nThe High Courts of Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh have original jurisdiction, i.e. a case may be instituted before them in the first instance. These Courts also have a pecuniary limit, below which they may not exercise original 1 jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe remaining High Courts have only appellate jurisdiction, over orders and\\n\\njudgments passed by lower courts and tribunals over which they exercise jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn its writ jurisdiction, a High Court is empowered to enforce fundamental rights and for any other purpose guaranteed to each citizen of India under the Constitution and remedy any violation thereof. For this purpose, the High Court may issue directions, orders, or writs (including of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari).\\n\\nIn its appellate jurisdiction, a High Court is the highest court of appeal in a State and the final court of appeal (except in specific cases where the Supreme Court has been statutorily conferred with appellate jurisdiction).\\n\\n1 As of April 2023, the pecuniary jurisdiction of these High Courts is for a claim above:\\n\\nINR 10,000,000/- in the Bombay High Court INR 1,000,000/- in the Calcutta High Court INR 10,000,000/- in the Madras High Court INR 20,000,000/- in the Delhi High Court INR 10,000,000/- in the Himachal Pradesh High Court\\n\\n14 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nThe High Court also exercises testamentary and intestate jurisdiction, for probates, challenging a will, issuance of letters of administration and succession certificates etc. for administration of the estate of a deceased person.\\n\\nThe High Courts in the coastal states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Orissa and Tamil Nadu exercise admiralty jurisdiction. This jurisdiction extends over any ship that is present in their territorial waters (irrespective of whether or not she is a national of, or registered in India, regardless of residence, or domicile of her owners). In India, an action in rem lies in a High Court against a foreign-owned ship, for a cause of action arising from tort, or a breach of obligation under a contract for carriage of goods from a port in India to a foreign port.\\n\\nDistrict Courts:\\n\\nIn metropolitan areas, the principal court of original jurisdiction is the City Civil Court and the High Court of the relevant State is the court of appeal. In non-metropolitan areas, the Court of Civil Judge, Senior and Junior Divisions, is the principal court of original jurisdiction and the District Court is the court of appeal. The principal court of criminal jurisdiction in a State is the Sessions Court below which lie the Chief Judicial Magistrate\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nand the Judicial Magistrate (First and Second class).\\n\\nSmall Causes Court:\\n\\nThe Small Causes Courts in India may be broadly classified as Presidency Small Causes Courts in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata enacted under the Presidency Small Causes Courts Act, 1882 (“Presidency Act”) and Provincial Small Causes Courts enacted under the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887 (“Provincial Act”). The Provincial Act governs small causes courts in places other than Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata.\\n\\nEach State has the power to amend the Provincial or Presidency Acts to fix the pecuniary and territorial jurisdiction of small causes courts to suit its own requirements. Broadly, these acts provide for small causes courts to deal with matters within their pecuniary jurisdiction as fixed by the aforementioned governing acts, as modified by the State. The idea as the name suggests is for matters which are of relatively small value to be decided by these courts, though the pecuniary jurisdiction of the small causes courts, vary from State to State.\\n\\nThe small causes courts also have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate proceedings under rent control laws, municipality laws, election petitions, anti-corruption matters, debt relief\\n\\n15 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nlaws, motor vehicles laws, motor accident claims, payment of wages etc. as have been granted by various state amendments. As a result of the subject matter jurisdiction, in practice small causes courts also hear high value matters relating to matters such as rent disputes which tend to be hotly contested.\\n\\nCommercial Courts:\\n\\nThe Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 which was amended in 2018 to be called the Commercial Courts, Commercial Appellate Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015 (“Commercial Courts Act”), came into force on October 23, 2015 (coincidentally, with the 2015 amendments to the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996). Specialized commercial courts and divisions were set up for expeditious resolution of the growing number of commercial cases, pursuant to the Government’s\\n\\n03\\n\\nStructure of Legal Profession\\n\\nThe Bar is unified and qualified lawyers enrolled with any State Bar Council can appear before any Indian court. However, in order to represent and appear for a party in any legal proceeding before a District Court, High Court, or the Supreme\\n\\n16 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nstated intent to improve India’s ability to enforce contracts. The Commercial Courts Act envisaged the setting up of special commercial courts to adjudicate commercial disputes in a time bound manner. Consequently, civil cases in relation to commercial disputes and claims above a certain specified value (originally INR 10 million, but reduced in 2018 to INR 0.3 million), which would have been otherwise adjudicated by an ordinary court, now fall under the jurisdiction of the C o m m e rc i a l C o u r t a n d t h e Commercial Division of High Court, respectively. Appeals arising out of such disputes lie before the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court.\\n\\nPursuant to amendments made in 2018, commercial courts are being established at the district level even in territories where the State High Court exercises original jurisdiction (where the relevant High Court would have a Commercial Division).\\n\\nCourt, an advocate, or law firm must be registered with the concerned State Bar\\n\\nCouncil.\\n\\nAn advocate of at least 10 years standing\\n\\nmay be designated a “Senior Advocate”\\n\\nby the Supreme Court or the High Court\\n\\nwith which he is registered if, in the\\n\\nopinion of the Supreme Court or that High\\n\\nCourt the advocate possesses expertise\\n\\nand character befitting the status. Such a\\n\\ndesignated Senior Advocate plays a role\\n\\nquite similar to that of a Queen’s Counsel.\\n\\nThe distinction between ‘solicitors’ and ‘advocates’ was removed in 1976. Nevertheless, the Bombay Incorporated Law Society, under the aegis of the Bombay High Court, conducts the qualification examination for solicitors. Solicitors have the same right of audience as advocates.\\n\\nUnder Indian law, specifically, the Advocates Act, 1961, only qualified advocates enrolled with the Bar Council of India are permitted to practice law in India. Insofar as foreign lawyers are concerned, given the rise in the number of international commercial arbitrations involving foreign parties, the Supreme Court of India in Bar Council of India v. A K Balaji & Ors. (2018) 5 SCC 379 held that foreign lawyers are entitled to give legal advice on foreign law involving diverse international legal issues on ‘casual’ visits to India. This was on the basis that such casual visits would not amount to the ‘practice of law’, which would include appearances in courts, giving of opinions, drafting of instruments and participation in conferences involving legal discussion. Recognising that international\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\narbitration would lend itself to such casual visits, the Apex Court noted that foreign lawyers could fly in and fly out to conduct arbitration proceedings, however, they will be governed by the code of conduct applicable to the legal profession in India, and the Bar Council or Union of India are at liberty to frame rules.\\n\\nBuilding on this judgment, on March 10, 2023 the Bar Council of India (BCI) notified the Bar Council of India Rules for Registration and Regulation of Foreign Lawyers and Foreign Law Firms in India, 2022, regulating the entry of foreign lawyers and foreign law firms in India on a reciprocal basis. Foreign lawyers or firms can continue to practice law on a ‘fly in fly out’ basis to provide legal advice “regarding foreign law and on diverse international legal issues” and if: (i) the advice is procured by the client in a foreign country; (ii) the foreign lawyer or firm does not maintain an o\\x00ce in India; and (iii) the practice in India does not cumulatively exceed 60 days in any period of 12 months.\\n\\nA foreign lawyer or firm can practice law in India in non-litigious matters only, subject to exceptions laid down in the Rules. Foreign lawyers will be permitted to represent foreign parties in international commercial arbitrations, but not in domestic arbitrations or litigations before any Indian court or tribunal.\\n\\n17 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n04\\n\\nAppointment of Judges\\n\\nOnly an Indian citizen may be appointed as a member of the judiciary. Appointments to the lower judiciary must qualify by clearing the Civil Services (Judicial) Exam conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. A citizen, having held judicial o\\x00ce for at least 10 years, or an advocate, registered as an advocate of a High Court (or of two or more High Courts in succession) for more than 10 years may be appointed as a Judge of a High Court. To be appointed a judge of the Supreme Court, the citizen must have served as a judge of a High Court (or of two or more High Courts in succession) for more than five years, or have practised as an advocate of a High Court (or of two or more High Courts in\\n\\n05\\n\\nJurisdiction of Courts\\n\\nJurisdiction of Indian courts is limited by territory, pecuniary value of the claim / dispute and / or subject matter. A court would have territorial jurisdiction over a dispute if the defendant habitually resides, carries on business, or works for gain within its territory, or, if the cause of action arose, or immoveable property which is the subject matter of the claim lies, within the territorial limits of such court.\\n\\nThe pecuniary jurisdiction of courts is determined by the relevant State in which\\n\\n2 See Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn., (2021) 2 SCC 1.\\n\\n18 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nsuccession) for more than ten years, or must, in the opinion of the President of India, be a distinguished jurist. The age of retirement of a High Court judge, is 62 years, while a Supreme Court judge is required to retire at the age of 65 years. There have been proposals to increase the retirement age, but these have not yet been put through.\\n\\nthe court is situated. The valuation of a plainti\\x00’s claim (and defendant’s counter-claim, if any), determines which court would have pecuniary jurisdiction over the case.\\n\\nSubject matter also plays a part, and exclusive jurisdiction may be statutorily conferred upon certain courts or tribunals, to the exclusion of regular civil courts and/or arbitral tribunals , depending on the type of claims or dispute (as more particularly explained below).\\n\\n2\\n\\n06\\n\\nExclusive Jurisdiction Clauses\\n\\nIndian courts recognize the contractual right of parties to stipulate exclusive jurisdiction provisions in their contracts. Most of the judicial pronouncements on jurisdiction clauses relate to exclusive jurisdiction of one Indian court over others and these stipulations have been uniformly enforced subject to the exception that parties, by contract, cannot confer jurisdiction upon a court which would ordinarily not have jurisdiction under Indian law. This does not apply to arbitration clauses, where the seat of the arbitration, though not otherwise having any connection to the parties or subject matter, would nevertheless confer jurisdiction upon the courts of the seat.\\n\\nHowever, in relation to provisions conferring exclusive jurisdiction on\\n\\n07\\n\\nGoverning Law Clauses\\n\\nParties are free to choose a foreign law to govern their relationship, where at least one party is a foreign party. In such cases, Indian courts will apply the law chosen by the parties to such a contract, subject to the foreign law being pleaded and proved as a fact (including through expert evidence, if required). If not so proved, it will be assumed that the legal position under the foreign law is the same as that existing under Indian law.\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nforeign courts, while the principle is recognised, Indian courts may refuse to give up jurisdiction on the grounds of forum non conveniens, balance of convenience, the interests of justice and\\n\\nInsofar as governing law is concerned in a contract between Indian parties where there is no foreign element, while there is no specific case law on the issue, it is possible that should the parties for some reason decide to subject the contract to foreign law, an argument may be taken that such contracting out of Indian law would be contrary to public policy.\\n\\n19 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n08\\n\\nCourt Fees\\n\\nCourt fees are payable by a plainti\\x00 at the time of filing a suit, under the Court Fees Act, 1870, although some States have their respective State Acts and the court fees vary from State to State.

The period of limitation is computed from the date of accrual of the cause of action, or in the case of a continuing cause of action, from each such day on which it accrues. Limitation for civil actions and suits for which no period of limitation is prescribed is generally 3 years. Limitation for claims on tortuous liability is generally 1 year. Limitation for suits to recover possession of immovable property is 12 years. Limitation for execution of a decree is also 12 years. Limitation for suits by, or on behalf of the government is 30 years. Limitation for filing an appeal varies between 30 days to 90 days.\\n\\nLimitation may be extended under certain circumstances, for instance, where there has been a part-payment or acknowledgment in writing of a debt\\n\\n20 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\n0.3 million), or may be ad valorem, without a cap, (for example, the Delhi High Court levies court fees on an ad valorem basis depending on the value of the claim).

A court may however, under certain limited circumstances, condone delay in filing appeals.\\n\\nIn light of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Supreme Court in exercise of its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution suspended the period of limitation for all claims for nearly 24 months, thereby permitting such claims to be brought even after the strict period of limitation had lapsed, subject to certain rules for the calculation of such limitation.\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n10\\n\\nCivil Proceedings against the State\\n\\nThe State is not immune and cannot claim immunity from civil proceedings, except in respect of certain sovereign functions.

A party seeking interim relief should satisfy the court of the following three conditions:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nthere is a prima facie case in favour of the party seeking the order;\\n\\nii. irreparable damage defeating the very purpose of the suit may be caused to the party if the relief is not granted; and\\n\\niii. the balance of convenience lies with\\n\\nthe party requesting the order.\\n\\n29 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n22.2\\n\\nTypes of Interim Reliefs\\n\\na. Attachment before Judgment: The court, if satisfied that the defendant, with intent to obstruct, or delay the execution of any decree that may be passed against it, is about to abscond, or leave the local limits of the court’s jurisdiction; or, remove / dispose of the whole, or any part of its property from the jurisdiction of the court, it may require the defendant to furnish security to produce and place at the disposal of the court when required, the property, or the value of the same as may be su\\x00cient to satisfy the decree. In making such an order, the court may direct conditional attachment of the whole, or any portion of the property of the defendant. If the defendant fails to show cause against attachment, or fails to furnish the security required, the court may order that property (su\\x00cient to satisfy any decree which may be passed in the suit) be attached.\\n\\nThe attachment will not a\\x00ect rights over assets or properties which were in existence prior to the attachment, of persons not parties to the suit (for example a tenancy).\\n\\nb. Injunction: A court may pass orders of temporary injunction restraining a defendant from taking some action, where it is satisfied that the property\\n\\n30 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nin dispute in the suit is in danger of waste, damage, alienation, or that the defendant threatens, or intends to remove, or dispose of its property with a view to defraud its creditors.\\n\\nc. Status quo Order: Status quo generally refers to the existing state of a\\x00airs, or circumstances. In some respects, similar to an injunction, a status quo order may be issued to prevent any of the parties involved in a suit from taking any action that may alter the existing state of things. The intent of such an order is to prevent harm, or preserve the existing conditions, so that a party\\'s position is not prejudiced in the interim.\\n\\nd. Receiver: A court is empowered to appoint a receiver of any property when it is just and convenient to do so. In a mortgagee’s suit for foreclosure, or sale, where the mortgagee is entitled to enter into possession on default of payment of the mortgage money, the mortgagee is prima facie entitled to the appointment of receiver.\\n\\ne. Other Orders: A court may pass such interim orders as may be necessary to preserve the subject matter of the dispute or the rights of the parties, for example, disclosure of assets, furnishing of security, etc.\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n22.3\\n\\nEx-Parte Orders in case of urgency\\n\\nIn cases of urgency, such as where the rights of a plainti\\x00 may be defeated should such relief not be granted immediately, a court may pass an ad- interim order granting relief, on an ex parte basis, without directing notice to be\\n\\nissued to the defendant. In such an event, the defendant may apply for vacation / modification of the order passed and after hearing the parties, the order may be vacated, modified, or confirmed.\\n\\n22.4\\n\\nUndertaking by a party applying for interim relief to pay damages\\n\\nCertain courts, for instance the Bombay High Court, mandate a party to whom interim relief has been granted, to provide a written undertaking before such order granting interim relief is\\n\\nissued, to pay damages as the court may award to compensate the other party in the event the other party is a\\x00ected or prejudiced by such order.\\n\\n23\\n\\nSubstantive / Final Relief\\n\\nIndian courts have wide powers to mould the reliefs and to make such orders as may be necessary to meet the ends of justice and to award substantive relief. Such relief includes declarations of title,\\n\\nor status, specific performance of contracts, permanent injunctions, damages, accounts, etc. Punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded in exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n31 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n24\\n\\nSpecific Performance\\n\\nPrior to the Specific Relief (Amendment) Act, 2018 (“SR Amendment Act”) Prior to the SR Amendment Act, the grant of specific performance of a contract under the Specific Relief Act, 1963, was discretionary. Specific performance could be granted only where, (a) there existed no standard for ascertaining actual damage caused by the non-performance of the act agreed to be done and of which specific performance was sought; or (b) when the act agreed to be done is such that compensation in money for its non-performance would not a\\x00ord adequate relief.\\n\\nCertain contracts could not be specifically enforced, such as contracts where, (a) the non- performance of which compensation would be an adequate relief; (b) the contract runs into such minute or numerous details or which is so dependent on the personal qualifications or volition of the parties, or otherwise from its nature is such, that the court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms; (c) the contract is, in its nature d e t e r m i n a b l e ; a n d ( d ) t h e performance of which involves the performance of a continuous duty which the court cannot supervise.\\n\\n32 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nAfter the SR Amendment Act\\n\\nThe SR Amendment Act came into force on October 1, 2018. It limits the court’s discretion by making specific relief mandatory as opposed to discretionary. The Court may grant specific performance of contracts (a) in which there exist no standards to ascertain the actual damage caused by non-performance of such contracts, or (b) wherein the act agreed to be done is such that monetary compensation for non- performance would not a\\x00ord adequate relief to the party su\\x00ering breach. Further, a rebuttable presumption is created that breach of contract for transfer of immovable property cannot be adequately relieved by monetary compensation, whereas breach of contract for transfer of movable property may be relieved by monetary compensation, except inter alia, when the subject matter of the contract is not an ordinary article of commerce, or is of special value to the buyer, or consists of goods which are not readily obtainable in the market. The Act in its present form gives a discretionary power to the courts to award specific performance only in exceptional cases, with monetary compensation being the norm.\\n\\nThe nature of contracts for which specific performance may be denied has been made narrower, i.e. in the following circumstances: (a) where a party to the contract has obtained substituted performance; (b) where directing specific performance would involve the performance of a continuous duty which a court cannot supervise; (c) where the contract is so dependent on the personal qualifications of the parties that the court cannot enforce specific performance of its material terms; (d) where a contract is determinable in nature.\\n\\nSubstituted Performance\\n\\nThe concept of allowing the innocent party to obtain substituted performance from a third party or its own agency and recover expenses and costs actually incurred or su\\x00ered, from the breaching party, has been introduced by the SRA Amendment Act. Once such substituted performance has been obtained, the\\n\\n25\\n\\nCosts\\n\\nIndian law recognises the principle that costs follow the event i.e. the costs of legal proceedings are awarded to the successful litigant. Courts are also empowered to direct payment of compensatory costs by a party who frivolously delays proceedings, or knowingly raises false, or vexatious\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\ninnocent party is not entitled to seek specific performance.\\n\\nSpecial status to Infrastructure\\n\\nprojects\\n\\nAn all new section provides that in case of contractual disputes relating to infrastructure projects, the court shall not grant an injunction in any suit, where it would cause hindrance or delay in the continuance or completion of the infrastructure project.\\n\\nclaims, or defences. The awarding of costs is up to the discretion of the court and the court has the power to determine by whom, or out of what property and to what extent such costs are to be paid. In practice the costs awarded are substantially lower than the costs actually incurred, although the new\\n\\n33 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nCommercial Courts Act provides for a general rule for payment of costs by the judgment debtor and sets out the basis of awarding costs.\\n\\nIndian courts may order security for costs from a plainti\\x00 not resident in India, if it does not possess su\\x00cient immovable property, or assets in India to satisfy any decree that may be passed against him. In cases where the subject of the suit is immoveable property, courts will direct such plainti\\x00s, who do not possess su\\x00cient immoveable property in India, to furnish security for any anticipated costs on the defendant. The quantum of such anticipated costs and required security is left to the discretion of the courts. Where such security is directed to be furnished by a plainti\\x00, the suit may be dismissed if such security is not provided.\\n\\nThe amendments made to the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act ensures that the commercial court has wide discretion to determine, whether costs are payable, by whom and what quantum. Certain points that may be kept in mind are:\\n\\nCosts shall mean ‘reasonable costs’, relating to fees and expenses of witnesses, legal fees and expenses, any other expenses incurred in connection therewith.\\n\\nCost to follow event mechanism – “... the general rule is that the unsuccessful party shall be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party.\\n\\n9 Vijay Karia v.

For instance, in Vijay 9 Karia v. Prysmian Cavi E Sistemi SRL, the appellants applied to the Supreme Court for special leave to appeal (under Article 136 of the Constitution of India), against the Bombay High Court’s order to enforce a foreign award. The Apex Court passed this order by observing that the Appellants were “indulging in a speculative litigation with the fond hope that by flinging mud on a foreign arbitral award, some of the mud flung would stick”, and given t h a t t h e C o u r t ’ s t i m e w a s unnecessarily taken up, imposed exemplary costs of INR 50 lakhs on the appellants.\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n26\\n\\nThird Party Funding\\n\\nIn its purest form, the third party funding of a dispute is an arrangement between a funder and a litigant in which the funder ‘funds’ or provides monetary support to a litigant for pursuing and / or enforcing a claim, in exchange for a share in any ensuing award or settlement. The funding provided is ‘non-recourse’ and the funder is repaid the funded amount (its investment) along with its profit, only upon a successful outcome of the action, and not otherwise. The investment or the asset is the litigant’s claim or award.\\n\\nWhile there is no express legislation or regulation around litigation financing (as it is also known) in India , there have been several decisions by superior courts which endorse the view that third party funding of disputes is not barred under Indian law. However, although the principles of maintenance and champerty are not applicable in India, agreements which are found to be extortionate and unconscionable, for instance completely one-sided and usurious – say a majority share in the recoveries made, may be treated as being contrary to public policy.\\n\\n10\\n\\ncircumstances). The financier may be required to give security for the payment of all costs incurred and likely to be incurred by any defendant. This amendment, made more than two decades ago, carries the implicit assumption that a plainti\\x00 has been funded in its civil litigation (and that therefore, litigation financing, is permitted).\\n\\nThe Arbitration Act, as amended in 2015, also contains an implied recognition that there may be cases funded by a party not otherwise concerned with the dispute. A potential arbitrator is required to disclose any circumstances, which are likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality.\\n\\nIn its landmark decision, in Bar Council of India v.

Decisions of a High Court are binding within that State; a decision of the High Court of one State is only persuasive in other States. The decision of larger benches of the Supreme Court would be binding on smaller benches (e.g.\\n\\nA decision rendered by a three judge bench would be binding on a proceeding before a two judge bench). This principle of judicial discipline also applies to High Courts.\\n\\nThe CPC recognises the principle of res judicata and a final decision on any matter by a competent court is binding on the parties to the litigation and persons claiming under, or through the parties. The same issue cannot be further litigated in subsequent proceedings.\\n\\n28\\n\\nDecisions of Foreign Courts\\n\\nRulings of foreign courts are of persuasive value and not binding on Indian courts. Decisions of courts of Commonwealth Countries (most often, the UK), are often cited before High Courts and the Supreme Court in the absence of any binding decision of Indian\\n\\ncourts. Decisions of US courts, in constitutional matters, administrative principles, antitrust matters, and intellectual property or technology matters are also occasionally cited for persuasive value.\\n\\n12 Bar Council of India v.

So for instance, all matters relating to schemes of compromise, arrangement, amalgamation and reconstruction, insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings, shareholders disputes relating to oppression, mismanagement etc., are now heard by the NCLT, with appeals being heard by the NCLAT (instead of a High Court).\\n\\nThe jurisdiction of the NCLT / NCLAT is exclusive and the Companies Act, 2013 mandates that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter\\n\\nwhich the said Tribunals are empowered to determine. The NCLT thus also reduces the burden of District Courts and High Courts which have huge backlogs and frees up judges to hear other matters.\\n\\nThe NCLT has its Principal Bench in New 17 Delhi and 15 other Benches across India. The NCLAT has its Principal Bench in New Delhi and one other Bench in Chennai.\\n\\nAll proceedings pending before the BIFR and the AAIFR, constituted under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 (which was also repealed in 2016)), stand abated, although the concerned company in respect of which such proceeding stands abated, has the liberty of initiating fresh proceedings before the NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.\\n\\nOrders of the NCLT are appealable to the NCLAT. Additionally, the NCLAT also hears appeals against orders passed by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the Competition Commission of India and the National Financial Reporting Authority. An order from the NCLAT can be appealed to the Supreme Court if it is in respect of a question of law.\\n\\n17 As of April 2023, 16 Benches of NCLT, have been set up: two at New Delhi (being the Principal bench and the New Delhi Bench) and one each at Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Kochi, Cuttack, Amaravati, Indore and Mumbai.\\n\\n44 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n02\\n\\nProceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”)\\n\\nIBC was enacted with a view to consolidate the regime for re- organization and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner (180 days extendable to 270 days, although practically most cases take much longer), reduce stressed assets and enhance credit availability in the market.\\n\\n18\\n\\nThe NCLT has exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings arising under the IBC, such as applications for insolvency / liquidation, schemes for reconstruction, amalgamation and revival plans for financially distressed companies etc. Any ‘financial creditor’, ‘operational creditor’ or ‘corporate debtor’ is entitled to initiate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (“CIRP”). The IBC also provides for voluntary liquidation by a corporate entity.\\n\\niii) if the NCLT believes that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up;\\n\\niv) the a\\x00airs of the company have been conducted in a fraudulent manner; or, the company was formed for fraudulent and unlawful purpose or the persons concerned in its formation or management have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or misconduct in connection therewith; or\\n\\nv) if the company has made a default in filing with the Registrar of Companies its financial statements or annual returns for immediately preceding 5 consecutive financial years.\\n\\nUnder the Companies Act, 2013 a company may be wound up and liquidated by the NCLT, if:\\n\\ni) the company has passed a special resolution that it should be wound up by the Tribunal, i.e. a voluntary liquidation;\\n\\nii) the company has acted against the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order, decency or morality;\\n\\n18 As of April 2023, the provisions for insolvency resolution of individuals and partnership firms have only been notified qua personal\\n\\nguarantors of corporate debtors (and not for other individuals and partnership firms).\\n\\n45 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\nA financial default of at least INR 10 million can trigger the CIRP. Upon an application for CIRP being admitted by the NCLT, all other legal proceedings are automatically stayed by a moratorium period of 180 days, extendable by a further 90 days. The declaration of moratorium on the company prohibits any institution or continuation of litigation against the concerned company, mandates maintenance of status quo of the assets by the company including prohibition on any transferring, encumbering, alienating or disposing of such assets and requires the creditors to refrain from enforcing any security interest against the corporate debtor.\\n\\n19\\n\\nDuring the statutory moratorium period, an Interim Resolution Professional (and t h e r e a f t e r a f i n a l R e s o l u t i o n Professional), is appointed and a Creditors Committee (comprising financial creditors, secured or unsecured), is constituted to decide (with at least 66% majority) on a revival plan, if revival is possible, of the corporate debtor. The Resolution Professional manages the a\\x00airs of the corporate debtor and operates its business as a going concern under the broad directions of the Creditors’ Committee. Operational creditors do not possess the right to participate in the resolution process and the decision of the Creditors’ Committee is binding on them. Once approved by the NCLT, the plan is binding on all stakeholders; the corporate debtor, its\\n\\nemployees, shareholders, members, guarantors and creditors. The NCLT is vested with the discretion to finally approve or reject the resolution plan.\\n\\nAlternatively, if during the insolvency resolution process, the resolution professional informs the NCLT that the Committee of Creditors has not been able to agree on a resolution plan or has decided to liquidate the corporate debtor/ concerned company, the NCLT may then pass an order for such liquidation.\\n\\nSecured creditors have the right to either, relinquish their security interest and receive proceeds from the sale of assets by the liquidator, or to realize their security interest independently, although it may approach the NCLT to facilitate the realization of the security interest if required.\\n\\nThe entire liquidation process should be completed within 1 year. After the assets of the corporate debtor have been completely liquidated, the liquidator makes an application to the NCLT for the dissolution of the corporate debtor and the NCLT passes an order declaring that the corporate debtor stands dissolved from the date of such order.\\n\\nThe IBC further provides that the proceeds from the assets in the liquidation trust shall be distributed in the following order of priority: a) first, the insolvency resolution process costs and\\n\\n19 The minimum pecuniary threshold for initiating CIRP under IBC has been increased from INR 0.1 million to INR 10 million vide\\n\\nNotification no.

The prior approval of two- thirds of its members and two-thirds (in value), of its creditors is also required. As is the case with the regular liquidation procedure, the liquidator is to make an application to the NCLT in the place where the a\\x00airs of the corporate person have been completely wound up and the NCLT will pass an order stating that the corporate debtor shall stand dissolved from the date of such order.\\n\\n47 2023 © Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas\\n\\nGuide to Litigation in India\\n\\n03\\n\\nDebt Recovery Tribunal (“DRT”) and Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (“DRAT”)\\n\\nRecovery actions by Banks and\\n\\nFinancial Institutions\\n\\nThe DRT and DRAT have been constituted under the provisions of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993(“RDB Act”), for establishment of Tribunals for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions and for matters connected therewith. There are 39 DRT\\'s and 5 DRAT\\'s functioning in India.\\n\\nThe DRT has exclusive jurisdiction (to the exclusion of all other courts), to decide cases filed by banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts exceeding INR 2 million. (If the claim is less than INR 2 million, it would have to be filed before a regular civil court). On a successful application the DRT issues a recovery certificate in favour of the applicant bank / financial institution, pursuant to which the debt may be recovered through various measures such as attachment and sale of moveable or immoveable properties, arrest of the debtor, detention to prison and appointment of receiver.\\n\\nAppeals against orders of the DRT may be filed before the DRAT. Orders of the DRAT and/or the DRT cannot be challenged before a civil court.\\n\\nHowever, this prohibition does not exclude the writ jurisdiction of a High Court or the ability to apply to the Supreme Court for special leave to appeal against any order.\\n\\nJurisdiction under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 (the “SARFAESI Act”) The DRT also has jurisdiction in relation to applications filed by or against a defaulting borrower / mortgagor / guarantor in relation to actions of a Secured Creditor (such as Banks / Financial Institutions) initiated under the SARFAESI Act, for enforcement of security interest (i.e. security including mortgage or charge on immovable properties given for due repayment of a loan).\\n\\nThe SARFESI Act is unique in that it empowers banks and other financial institutions to issue demand notices to defaulting borrowers and guarantors calling upon them to discharge their dues in full within 60 days from the date of the notice.

The financial market is also expanding and attracting ever-increasing number of domestic and foreign investors. Efficient transfer of resources from those having idle resources to others who have a pressing need for them is achieved through financial markets.\\n\\nThe functioning of financial markets is regulated by several legislations that include Acts, Rules, Regulations, Guidelines, Circulars, etc. Understanding the legislations governing the financial markets in India will give the reader a fair idea of how the financial markets in India are regulated.\\n\\nI am glad that the Committee on Financial markets and Investors’ Protection of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is bringing out ‘A Guide on Laws applicable to Indian Financial Markets’. It covers the various legislations governing the financial markets in India. It aims to provide substantive and useful information to both a professional and common man.\\n\\nI take this opportunity to congratulate CA. Rajkumar S.Adukia, Chairman and the entire team of Committee on Financial Markets and Investors’ Protection for their initiatives and endeavours.\\n\\nCA. Subodh K. Agrawal President The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\\n\\nPreface\\n\\n\"Financial peace isn\\'t the acquisition of stuff. It\\'s learning to live on less than you make, so you can give money back and have money to invest. You can\\'t win until you do this.\"\\n\\nDave Ramsey\\n\\nNormally, a business enterprise needs finance for two purposes - for buying capital equipment and fixed assets, such as machinery, tools and implements, power plant, construction of factory building and workshops, etc.; which are referred long-term capital requirements, and for buying raw materials, holding the stock of finished goods, for payment of wages, etc., which are referred to as short-term capital requirements. Thus, an industrial house has to borrow short-term funds as well as long-term funds. The money- market caters to the short-term needs only. The long-term capital needs are satisfied by the capital market. Thus the combination of both money market and capital market forms the financial market. The financial market covers the instruments and institutions which provide finance for short and long period.\\n\\nto as\\n\\nFinancial markets provide channels for allocation of savings to investment. It provides a variety of assets to savers as well as various forms in which the investors can raise funds and thereby combine the acts of saving and investment. The savers and investors are constrained not by their individual abilities, but by the economy’s ability, to invest and save respectively. Thus, the financial markets contribute to economic development to the extent that the latter depends on the rates of savings and investment.\\n\\nIt has been argued that strong legal systems foster development of sophisticated financial markets and intermediaries, which enhances the economy’s ability to manage risk and eventually lead to economic growth. The financial system of India which includes banking, capital, insurance, securities, foreign exchange etc. is characterized by several legislations for regulation and enforcement. Just like the developments and changes in financial markets are\\n\\nclosely monitored, the regular changes in the financial laws of our country also need to be followed. This book gives a broad view of the legislations regulating the financial markets in India.\\n\\nI sincerely appreciate the efforts put in by Adv. Y.

It is crucial to the system in a modern economy. They channel household savings to the corporate sector and allocate investment funds among firms; they allow inter temporal smoothing of consumption by households and expenditures by firms; and they enable households and firms to share risks. These functions are common to the financial systems of most developed economies.\\n\\nThe financial system in India comprises of financial institutions, financial markets, financial instruments and services.\\n\\n1.1.\\t What\\tis\\ta\\tfinancial\\tmarket?\\n\\nFinancial market is a broad term describing any marketplace where buyers and sellers participate in the trade of assets such as equities, bonds, currencies and derivatives. Financial market is typically defined by having transparent pricing, basic regulations on trading, costs and fees and market forces determining the prices of securities that trade.\\n\\nA market is a location where buyers and sellers come into contact to exchange goods or services. Markets can exist in various forms depending on various factors.\\n\\n3\\n\\nThe financial markets permit both business and government to raise the needed funds by selling securities. Simultaneously, investors with excess funds are able to invest and earn a return, enhancing their welfare. Financial markets are absolutely vital for the proper functioning of capitalistic economies, because they serve to channel funds from savers to borrowers.\\n\\nFinancial\\tmarkets\\tfacilitate:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe raising of capital (in the capital markets)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe transfer of risk (in the derivatives markets)\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice discovery\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal transactions with integration of financial markets\\n\\n\\n\\nThe transfer of liquidity (in the money markets)\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational trade (in the currency markets)\\n\\n\\n\\nand are used to match those who want capital to those who have it.\\n\\n1.2.\\t Basic\\tfunctions\\tof\\tfinancial\\tmarkets\\n\\nFinancial markets serve six basic functions. These functions are briefly listed below:\\n\\n\\n\\nBorrowing and Lending: Financial markets permit the transfer of funds (purchasing power) from one agent to another for either investment or consumption purposes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice Determination: Financial markets provide vehicles by which prices are set both for newly issued financial assets and for the existing stock of financial assets.\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation Aggregation and Coordination: Financial markets act as collectors and aggregators of information about financial asset values and the flow of funds from lenders to borrowers.\\n\\n\\n\\nRisk Sharing: Financial markets allow a transfer of risk from those who undertake investments to those who provide funds for those investments.\\n\\n\\n\\nLiquidity: Financial markets provide the holders of financial assets with a chance to resell or liquidate these assets.\\n\\n\\n\\nEfficiency: Financial markets reduce transaction costs and information costs.\\n\\n4\\n\\n1.3.\\t Types\\tof\\tfinancial\\tmarkets\\n\\nWithin the financial sector, the term “financial markets” is often used to refer just to the markets that are used to raise finance: for long term finance, the Capital markets; for short term finance, the Money markets. Another common use of the term is as a catchall for all the markets in the financial sector, as per examples in the breakdown below.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapital markets which consist of:\\n\\n\\n\\nStock markets, which provide financing through the issuance of shares or common stock, and enable the subsequent trad- ing thereof.\\n\\n\\n\\nBond markets, which provide financing through the issuance of bonds, and enable the subsequent trading thereof.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommodity markets, which facilitate the trading of commodities.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoney markets, which provide short term debt financing and investment.\\n\\n\\n\\nDerivatives markets, which provide management of financial risk.\\n\\ninstruments\\n\\nfor\\n\\n\\n\\nFutures markets, which provide standardized forward contracts for trading products at some future date;\\n\\n\\n\\nInsurance markets, which facilitate the redistribution of various risks.\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign exchange markets, which facilitate the trading of foreign exchange.\\n\\nThe Money market refers to the market where borrowers and lenders exchange short term funds to solve their liquidity needs. Money market instruments are generally financial claims that have low default risk, maturities under one year and high marketability.\\n\\nThe Capital market is a market for financial investments that are direct or indirect claims to capital. It is wider than the Securities Market and embraces all forms of lending and borrowing, whether or not evidenced by the creation of a negotiable financial instrument.\\n\\nThe Securities Market, however, refers to the markets for those financial instruments/ claims/obligations that are commonly and readily transferable by sale. It is a place where buyers and sellers of securities can enter into transactions to purchase and sell shares, bonds,\\n\\n5\\n\\nthe\\n\\ndebentures etc. Further, it performs an important role of enabling corporate, entrepreneurs to raise resources for their companies and business ventures through public issues. Transfer of resources from those having idle resources (investors) to others who have a need for them (corporates) is most efficiently achieved through the securities market.\\n\\nDebt Market - Debt instrument represents a contract whereby one party lends money to another on pre-determined terms with regards to rate and periodicity of interest, repayment of principal amount by the borrower to the lender. In the Indian securities markets, the term ‘bond’ is used for debt instruments issued by the Central and State governments and public sector organizations and the term ‘debenture’ is used for instruments issued by private corporate sector.\\n\\nThe National Stock Exchange of India started its trading operations in June 1994 by enabling the Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment of the Exchange. This segment provides a trading platform for a wide range of fixed income securities that includes central government securities, treasury bills (T-bills), state development loans (SDLs), bonds issued by public sector undertakings (PSUs), floating rate bonds (FRBs), zero coupon bonds (ZCBs), index bonds, commercial papers (CPs), certificates of deposit (CDs), corporate debentures, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions (FIs), bonds issued by foreign institutions and units of mutual funds (MFs).\\n\\nThe emergence of the Derivatives market, most notably forwards, futures and options, can be traced back to the willingness of risk-averse economic agents to guard themselves against uncertainties arising out of fluctuations in asset prices. By their very nature, the financial markets are marked by a very high degree of volatility. Through the use of derivative products, it is possible to partially or fully transfer price risks by locking–in asset prices. As instruments of risk management, these generally do not influence the fluctuations in the underlying asset prices. Derivative is a product whose value is derived from the value of one or more basic variables, called bases (underlying asset, index, or reference rate), in a contractual manner. The underlying asset can be equity, forex, commodity or any other asset.\\n\\nA commodity market is a market that trades in primary rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as (gold, rubber and oil). Investors access about 50 major commodity\\n\\n6\\n\\nmarkets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.\\n\\nMutual funds are investment companies that use the funds from investors to invest in other companies or investment alternatives. Mutual Fund Schemes may be classified on the Basis of its Structure and its Investment Objective. An open-ended mutual fund is the one whose units can be freely sold and repurchased by the investors. Closed- ended mutual funds have a fixed number of units, and a fixed tenure (3, 5, 10, or 15 years), after which their units are redeemed or they are made open-ended. These funds have various objectives: generating steady income by investing in debt instruments, capital appreciation by investing in equities, or both by making an equal allocation of the corpus in debt and equity instruments. Interval funds combine the features of open-ended and close-ended schemes. They are open for sale or redemption during pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices.\\n\\n1.4.\\t Major\\tplayers\\tin\\tfinancial\\tmarkets\\n\\ni.\\n\\nBrokers\\n\\nA broker is a commissioned agent of a buyer (or seller) who facilitates trade by locating a seller (or buyer) to complete the desired transaction. A broker does not take a position in the assets he or she trades - that is, the broker does not maintain inventories in these assets. The profits of brokers are determined by the commissions they charge to the users of their services (the buyers, the sellers, or both). Examples of brokers include real estate brokers and stock brokers.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nDealers\\n\\nLike brokers, dealers facilitate trade by matching buyers with sellers of assets; they do not engage in asset transformation. Unlike brokers, however, a dealer can and does “take positions” (i.e., maintain inventories) in the assets he or she trades that permit the dealer to sell out of inventory rather than always having to locate sellers to match every offer to buy. Also, unlike brokers, dealers do not receive sales commissions. Rather, dealers make profits by buying assets at 7\\n\\nrelatively low prices and reselling them at relatively high prices (buy low - sell high). Examples of dealers include dealers in government bonds and stock dealers.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nInvestment\\tBanks\\n\\nAn investment bank assists in the initial sale of newly issued securities (i.e., in IPOs = Initial Public Offerings) by engaging in a number of different activities like advice, underwriting, sales assistance etc.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nFinancial\\tIntermediaries\\n\\nUnlike brokers, dealers, and investment banks, financial intermediaries are financial institutions that engage in financial asset transformation. That is, financial intermediaries purchase one kind of financial asset from borrowers - generally some kind of long-term loan contract whose terms are adapted to the specific circumstances of the borrower (e.g., a mortgage) and sell a different kind of financial asset to savers, generally some kind of relatively liquid claim against the financial intermediary (e.g., a deposit account). In addition, unlike brokers and dealers, financial intermediaries typically hold financial assets as part of an investment portfolio rather than as an inventory for resale. Types of financial intermediaries include commercial banks, Life insurance companies, pension funds, finance companies, mutual funds etc.\\n\\n1.5.\\t Role\\tand\\tfunctions\\tof\\tfinancial\\tmarket\\n\\nOne of the important requisite for the accelerated development of an economy is the existence of a dynamic financial market. A financial market helps the economy in the following manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nSaving mobilization: Obtaining funds from the savers or surplus units such as household individuals, business firms, public sector units, central government, state governments etc. is an important role played by financial markets.\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestment: Financial markets play a crucial role in arranging to invest funds thus collected in those units which are in need of the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nNational Growth: An important role played by financial markets is that, they contribute to a nation’s growth by ensuring unfettered flow of surplus funds to deficit units. Flow of funds for productive purposes is also made possible.\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\nEntrepreneurship growth: Financial markets contribute to the development of the entrepreneurial class by making available the necessary financial resources.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustrial development: The different components of financial markets help an accelerated growth of industrial and economic development of a country, thus contributing to raising the standard of living and the society of well-being.\\n\\nThe\\tfunctions\\tof\\tfinancial\\tmarkets\\tinclude\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfer of Resources: Financial markets facilitate the transfer of real economic resources from lenders to ultimate borrowers.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnhancing income: Financial markets allow lenders to earn interest or dividend on their surplus invisible funds, thus contributing to the enhancement of the individual and the national income.\\n\\n\\n\\nProductive usage: Financial markets allow for the productive use of the funds borrowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapital Formation: Financial markets provide a channel through which new savings flow to aid capital formation of a country.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice determination: Financial markets allow for the determination of price of the traded financial assets through the interaction of buyers and sellers. They provide a sign for the allocation of funds in the economy based on the demand and supply through the mechanism called price discovery process.\\n\\n\\n\\nSale Mechanism: Financial markets provide a mechanism for selling of a financial asset by an investor so as to offer the benefit of marketability and liquidity of such assets.\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation: The activities of the participants in the financial market result in the generation and the consequent dissemination of information to the various segments of the market.\\n\\nFinancial\\tFunctions\\t–\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding the borrower with funds so as to enable them to carry out their investment plans.\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding the lenders with earning assets so as to enable them to earn wealth by deploying the assets in production debentures.\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding liquidity in the market so as to facilitate trading of funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nit provides liquidity to commercial bank\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\nit facilitates credit creation\\n\\n\\n\\nit promotes savings\\n\\n\\n\\nit promotes investment\\n\\n\\n\\nit facilitates balance economic growth\\n\\n\\n\\nit improves trading floors\\n\\n1.6.\\n\\nInternational\\tscope\\tof\\tfinancial\\tmarkets\\n\\nFinancial markets are increasingly becoming international in scope. Integration of transatlantic financial markets began early in the nineteenth century and accelerated after the mid-nineteenth-century introduction of the transoceanic telegraph systems. The process reversed early in the twentieth century due to World Wars I and II and the cold war; the demise of the gold standard; and the rise of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, discretionary monetary policy, and capital immobility. With the end of the Bretton Woods arrangement in the early 1970s and the cold war in the late 1980s/early 1990s, financial globalization reversed course once again. Today, governments, corporations, and other securities issuers (borrowers) can sell bonds, called foreign bonds, in a foreign country denominated in that foreign country’s currency. (For example, the Mexican government can sell dollar-denominated bonds in U.S. markets.) Issuers can also sell Eurobonds or Eurocurrencies, bonds issued (created and sold) in foreign countries but denominated in the home country’s currency. For example, U.S. companies can sell dollar denominated bonds in London and U.S. dollars can be deposited in non-U.S. banks. It now also quite easy to invest in foreign stock exchanges, many of which have grown in size and importance in the last few years.\\n\\n10\\n\\n2.\\t WHAT\\tIS\\tCAPITAL\\tMARKET?\\n\\nCapital market is one of the most important segments of the Indian financial system. It is the market available to the companies for meeting their requirements of the long-term funds.\\n\\nThe term capital market means institutional arrangements for facilitating the borrowing and lending of long term funds. In other words, it consists of a series of channels through which the savings of the community are made available for industrial and commercial enterprises.\\n\\nCapital market is the market for long term funds, just as the money market is the market for short term funds. It refers to all the facilities and the institutional arrangements for borrowing and lending term funds (medium-term and long-term funds). It does not deal in capital goods but is concerned with the raising of money capital for purposes of investment.\\n\\nThe market consists of a number of individuals and institutions (including the Government) that canalize the supply and demand for long -term capital and claims on it. The demand for long term capital comes predominantly from private sector manufacturing industries, agriculture sector, trade and the Government agencies. While, the supply of funds for the capital market comes largely from individual and corporate savings, banks, insurance companies, specialised financing agencies and the surplus of Governments.\\n\\nAmong\\tthe\\tinstitutions,\\twe\\tmay\\trefer\\tto\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nCommercial banks are important investors, but are largely interested in govt. securities and to a small extent, debentures of companies;\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nLIC and GIC are of growing importance in the Indian capital market, though their major interest is in government securities;\\n\\n(iii) Provident funds constitute a major medium of savings but their\\n\\ninvestment too are mostly in govt. securities; and\\n\\n(iv) Special institutions set up since independence, viz., IFCI, ICICI, IDBI, UTI, etc. –generally called development financial institutions (DFIs) –aim at supplying long term capital to the private sector.\\n\\n(v) There are financial intermediaries in the capital market, such as merchant bankers, mutual funds leasing companies etc. which\\n\\n11\\n\\nhelp in mobilizing savings and supplying funds to investors.\\n\\nLike all markets, the capital market is also composed of those who demand funds (borrowers) and those who supply funds (lenders). An ideal capital attempts to provide adequate capital at reasonable rate of return for any business which offers a prospective yield high enough to make borrowing worthwhile.\\n\\nThe size of a nation’s capital markets is directly proportional to the size of its economy. The United States, the world’s largest economy, has the biggest and deepest capital markets. Capital markets are increasingly interconnected in a globalized economy, which means that ripples in one corner can cause major waves elsewhere. The drawback of this interconnection is best illustrated by the global credit crisis of 2007- 09, which was triggered by the collapse in U.S. mortgage-backed securities. The effects of this meltdown were globally transmitted by capital markets since banks and institutions in Europe and Asia held trillions of dollars of these securities.\\n\\nDivision\\tof\\tCapital\\tMarket\\t-\\n\\n\\n\\nFinancial institutions\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities market\\n\\n\\n\\nGilt-edged market\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate securities market\\n\\n\\n\\nPrimary market\\n\\n\\n\\nSecondary market\\n\\nThe Indian capital market is broadly divided into the gilt-edged market and the securities market.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe gilt-edged market refers to the market for Government and semi-government securities, backed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Government securities are tradeable debt instruments issued by the Government for meeting its financial requirements. The term gilt-edged means ‘of the best quality’. This is because the Government securities do not suffer from risk of default and are highly liquid (as they can be easily sold in the market at their current price). The open market operations of the RBI are also conducted in such securities.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe securities market refers to the market which deals in equities and debentures of the corporates. It is further divided into primary\\n\\n12\\n\\nmarket and secondary market.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrimary market (new issue market):- deals with ‘new securities’, that is, securities which were not previously available and are offered to the investing public for the first time.\\n\\nThe issuer may be a new company or an existing company. These issues may be of new type or the security used in the past. In the primary market the issuer can be considered as a manufacturer. The issuing houses, investment bankers and brokers act as the channel of distribution for the new issues. They take the responsibility of selling the stocks to the public.\\n\\nThe main service functions of the primary market are origination, under writing and distribution. Origination deals with the origin of the new issue. The proposal is analyzed in terms of the nature of the security, the size of the issue, timing of the issue and floatation method of the issue. Underwriting contract makes the share predictable and removes the element of uncertainty in the subscription. Distribution refers to the sale of securities to the investors. This is carried out with the help of the lead managers and brokers to the issue.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecondary market/ stock market (old issues market or stock exchange):- is the market for buying and selling securities of the existing companies. Under this, securities are traded after being initially offered to the public in the primary market and/or listed on the stock exchange. The stock exchanges are the exclusive centres for trading of securities. It is a sensitive barometer and reflects the trends in the economy through fluctuations in the prices of various securities. It has been defined as, “a body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating and controlling the business of buying, selling and dealing in securities”. Listing on stock exchanges enables the shareholders to monitor the movement of the share prices in an effective manner. This assists those to take prudent decisions on whether to retain their holdings or sell off or even accumulate further. However, to list the securities on a stock exchange, the issuing company has to go through set norms and procedures.\\n\\nFeatures\\tof\\tCapital\\tMarket\\t-\\n\\n1.\\n\\nLink between Savers and Investment Opportunities:\\n\\nCapital market is a crucial link between saving and investment process. The capital market transfers money from savers to\\n\\n13\\n\\nentrepreneurial borrowers.\\n\\n2. Deals in Long Term Investment:\\n\\nCapital market provides funds for long and medium term. It does not deal with channelizing saving for less than one year.\\n\\n3. Utilizes Intermediaries:\\n\\nCapital market makes use of different intermediaries such as brokers, underwriters, depositories etc. These intermediaries act as working organs of capital market and are very important elements of capital market.\\n\\n4. Determinant of Capital Formation:\\n\\nThe activities of capital market determine the rate of capital formation in an economy. Capital market offers attractive opportunities to those who have surplus funds so that they invest more and more in capital market and are encouraged to save more for profitable opportunities.\\n\\n5. Government Rules and Regulations:\\n\\nThe capital market operates freely but under the guidance of government policies. These markets function within the framework of government rules and regulations, e.g., stock exchange works under the regulations of SEBI which is a government body.\\n\\nAn\\tideal\\tcapital\\tmarket\\tis\\tone:\\n\\n1. Where finance is available at reasonable cost.\\n\\n2. Which facilitates economic growth.\\n\\n3. Where market operations are free,\\n\\n3. Where market operations are transparent.\\n\\n4. Must provide sufficient information to investors.\\n\\n5. Must allocate capital productively.\\n\\n2.1.\\tHistory\\tof\\tCapital\\tMarket\\tin\\tIndia\\n\\nThe history of capital market system in India could be divided into two eras – pre-independence era and post-independence era.\\n\\nPre-independence\\tEra\\n\\nBefore independence, the capital market of India was ill developed. India during the British rule exhibited most of the fundamental characteristics 14\\n\\nof an underdeveloped economy in a distinct manner. Before the arrival of British in India, the economy of India had lost momentum and was fast settling down to a semi-static equilibrium condition. Two basic characteristics were prominent in the period before British rule started in India - a high degree of income inequality and conspicuous consumption (i.e. consumption of luxury items) by the wealthy class. The tendency of wasting the potential surplus of the country in conspicuous consumption by the richer class in the form of gold and silver hoards instead of investing it for creating bigger surplus for economic development persisted even after the British came to India.\\n\\nBritish were not keen in bringing out an all-round economic growth of India. Its main task was to make India complementary to Britain’s own economy and the maintenance of political control. In short, India’s lack of economic development must be attributed, in considerable measure, to her political subordinacy to Great Britain. With political subordinacy went economic subordinacy. From the beginning almost until the end of British ascendancy, India was regarded as a kind of economic complement to Britain. Accordingly, the development of an economically rounded and strong India was never a basic objective of British policy. The result was an automatic suppression of this stimulus to economic growth. A vast number of people were in a state of appalling poverty. The rate of savings in the economy was hopelessly low and the advances made in communications, trade and industry were scarcely enough to meet the pressure of population. The capital market in India suffered from certain defects in the pre-independence days –\\n\\n\\n\\nAgriculture, constituting the main occupation did not lend itself to the floatation of securities. Moreover, in the industrial sector itself production on small scale by sole trading and partnership firms did not leave much scope for the emergence of an organized securities market.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe growth of securities market was hampered because the foreign business enterprises, which accounted for the greater part of industrial development in the past, depended on the London Capital Market rather than on the Indian market.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe managing agency system, which was abolished after independence, to a large extent, was also responsible for the non-development of the capital market, for the managing agents acted both as promoting and marketing agencies and the capital market was characterized by an absence of special institutions to float new issues.\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nDue to underdevelopment of industries the total number of securities which were traded in on stock exchanges was not large. Government securities accounted for nearly half the total volume of issues in the capital market. Ordinary shares were the predominant type of security, while debentures and preference shares, whose price movements usually showed a close correlation with those of government securities, occupied a limited place.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe poor investment habits of the individuals and the restrictions imposed on the investment patterns of the various financial institutions circumscribed the capital market. The institutional investors primarily invested in Government and semi-Government securities. Further, the speculators were mostly interested in a short list of speculative shares. As a result, the class of investors to purchase industrial securities on a wide basis was small and there was absence of continuous dealings in a large range of securities.\\n\\nIn the unorganized sector of the capital market indigenous banking as different from the modern western banking had been organized in the form of family or individual business. The indigenous bankers have been variously called as Shroffs, Seths, Sahukars, Mahajans, Chettis etc. in different parts of the country. They vary in their size from petty moneylenders to substantial shroffs who carry on large and specialized business, which at times exceeds that of the scheduled banks. Despite the predominant role played by the indigenous bankers in India’s economic life, they have always remained outside the pale of organized banking. In 1935, when Reserve Bank of India had started many attempts to bring the indigenous bankers under its orbit and issued a draft scheme for direct linking of these bankers, RBI suggested that the indigenous bankers should give-up their trading and commission business, switch over to western system of accounting, develop the deposit side of banking activities, have their accounts audited by certified accountants, submit to RBI periodical statements of their affairs etc. RBI desired that the ambiguous character of the Hundi should cease and that it should become a negotiable instrument representing a genuine trade transaction. RBI also desired that the indigenous bankers should act as discount houses, (to buy and sell bills of exchange etc) and against these obligations, RBI promised to provide them with all the privileges enjoyed by scheduled banks. They would then be allowed to borrow from or rediscount bills of exchange at RBI on similar terms and conditions as available to scheduled banks.\\n\\nBut the indigenous bankers, with their age-old traditions of independence, 16\\n\\ndeclined to accept the restrictions as well as the compensating benefits of securing accommodation from RBI on favorable terms. They disagreed to give up their trading and commission business and accept deposits, thereby confining themselves to banking business only. They were also unwilling to give wide publicity to their accounts and their state of affairs. They did not consider that the privileges offered by RBI were adequate enough to compensate for the loss of their non-banking business. As a result, the scheme proposed by RBI to bring the indigenous bankers under its direct influence fell through.\\n\\nIn spite of all these defects, they occupy a very prominent position in the capital market in the country and at one time they were estimated to meet at least 90% of the financial requirements of the farmers and a substantial portion of the needs of the industry and trade.\\n\\nPost-Independence Era In recent years since independence, the capital market of India has substantially changed and has been changing for the better. The concentrated efforts on the part of the government and the growth of investment-mindedness of the people have made this possible. Capital market in India till the recent past, had all the characteristics of an underdeveloped economy. It was characterized by the conspicuous absence of institutions like, professional promoters, investment or issue houses, underwriting agencies and financial intermediaries. As a result, free flow of savings to industrial investment was impeded resulting in the stagnant character of our economy. Thus, serious flaws existed in the structure of capital market in India. However, the achievement of independence in 1947 marked a trend towards an organized growth of capital market. After achieving political independence, government took over the responsibility of giving shape to those coveted ideals of our economy, which were enshrined in our Constitution by way of the Directive Principles of state policy. When the Constitution was framed, the government defined its basic economic and social goals that were later on summed up in the expression “socialist pattern of society”. These ideals directed the government to promote the welfare of the society by securing and promoting a social order in which justice, equality and fraternity could prevail. The resolution was adopted at the Avadhi Session of Congress in 1954 to build the society on the socialistic pattern. “Ever since then this has been the light house of our economic policy”, “Growth with social justice” and “Social Gain not private Profit”, have been the major planks of our plan policies. These basic objectives had a significant bearing on the organization of the Capital Market. But it required effective control on government over the distribution of credit and finance and thus it could not be isolated\\n\\n17\\n\\nfrom the strategy of economic development.\\n\\nIn the post independence days, the government had committed itself to reorganize the Indian Capital Market. The government’s commitments towards industrialization also required the removal of basic deficiencies of the capital market. The existing financial institutions could only partly meet the financial requirements of industries. Priority now shifted from private ownership to public control. The first amongst these actions was the nationalization of RBI in 1948. The setting up of the SBI followed this, by taking over the Imperial Bank of India in 1956. In the same year the government also took a drastic action by rationalizing and merging as many as 245 life insurance companies into a state owned monolithic LIC of India. The year 1969 represents a landmark in the history of public control of private financial institutions when the 14 major Commercial Banks were nationalized.\\n\\nSetting up of Unit Trust of India, July 1, 1964 for mobilizing the small savings for investment in corporate securities and investment of life insurance funds and provident funds in industrial securities would help in strengthening the base of capital market. The changes in the growth of capital market in India can be analyzed also by a reference to the data relating to new issues of capital formation and working of corporate sectors. Various developments in the Indian capital market, removing its basic deficiencies, since independence can be reviewed as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe adoption of an elaborate legislative code to protect the investor’s interest has offered a salutary effect in the development of capital market. The Companies Act 1956, designed to safeguard the interest of shareholders, the Capital Issues (Control) Act to discourage undesirable practices like issue of shares with disproportionate voting rights and to prevent investment in non- essential enterprises, the Securities Contract (Regulations) Act 1956, to provide reforms in stock exchange trading methods and practices against undesirable manipulations, are some of the steps introduced to have a strong and healthy investment market having full confidence of the public.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe striking success of several industrial issues, home and foreign, indicate that in recent years more and more people have become investment conscious and ready to put their savings in corporate securities.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was no institutionalized system of underwriting in the country before independence. But during the post independence\\n\\n18\\n\\nperiod the under-writing activity made satisfactory progress with the establishment of specialized institutions of industrial finance. The underwriting operations got impetus by the establishment of strong underwriting organizations like, Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Unit Trust of India and Industrial Finance Corporation of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Unit Trust of India and Industrial Development Bank of India. The emergence of this institutionalized underwriting structure is of crucial importance for the efficient operation of the new issue market in the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe growth of capital market was indirectly influenced by the activities of Commercial Banks, which provided advances essentially for working capital against shares, and debentures, which thereby encouraged investment in industrial securities. Further, by providing funds to finance corporations through the purchase of their shares and debentures and by underwriting either singly or in association with other banks and institutions. Commercial Banks have greatly influenced the growth of capital market.\\n\\n\\n\\nImmediately after independence in 1947, the ardent need for large- scale industrial development paved the way for the establishment of several special finance and development corporations.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most striking change in the capital market is the integration of the organized and unorganized sectors of the capital market on the one hand and the money and the capital market on the other. The integration has been proceeding steadily due to the growth of joint stock form of business, the expanding role of the Reserve Bank in the sphere of rural credit, the extension of banking facilities into the interior of the country, the diversification of the functions of commercial bank and government assistance to industry have all been the contributive factors to this integration.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe establishment of Unit Trust of India (which started its public operations from July 1, 1964) and the Industrial Development Bank of India under the auspices of the Reserve Bank of India had a combining effect in strengthening and broadening the framework of the capital market in India as the source for the supply of funds to industry.\\n\\n2.2.\\tSecurities\\tmarket\\tin\\tIndia\\n\\nThe corporate securities market in India dates back to the 18th century\\n\\n19\\n\\nwhen the securities of the East India Company were traded in Mumbai and Kolkotta. The brokers used to gather under a Banyan tree in Mumbai and under a Neem tree in Kolkata for the purpose of trading those securities. However the real beginning came in the 1850’s with the introduction of joint stock companies with limited liability. The 1860’s witnessed feverish dealings in securities and reckless speculation. This brought brokers in Mumbai together in July 1875 to form the first formally organized stock exchange in the country viz. The Stock Exchange, Mumbai. Ahmedabad stock exchange in 1894 and 22 others followed this in the 20th century.\\n\\nThe process of reforms has led to a pace of growth almost unparalleled in the history of any country. The process of economic reforms and liberalization was set in motion in the mid-eighties and its pace was accelerated in 1991 when the economy suffered severely from a precariously low foreign exchange reserve, burgeoning imbalance on the external account, declining industrial production, galloping inflation and a rising fiscal deficit. The economic reforms, being an integrated process, included deregulation of industry, liberalization in foreign investment, regime, restructuring and liberalization of trade, exchange rate, and tax policies, partial disinvestments of government holding in public sector companies and financial sector reforms. The reforms in the real sectors such as trade, industry and fiscal policy were initiated first in order to create the necessary macroeconomic stability for launching financial sector reforms, which sought to improve the functioning of banking and financial institutions (FIs) and strengthen money and capital markets including securities market. The securities market reforms specifically included:\\n\\n\\n\\nRepeal of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 through which Government used to expropriate and allocate resources from capital market for favored uses;\\n\\n\\n\\nEnactment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 to provide for the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to regulate and promote development of securities market;\\n\\n\\n\\nSetting up of NSE in 1993, passing of the Depositories Act, 1996 to provide for the maintenance and transfer of ownership of securities in book entry form;\\n\\n\\n\\nAmendments to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 in 1999 to provide for the introduction of futures and option.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther measures included free pricing of securities, investor\\n\\n20\\n\\nprotection measures, technology, dematerialization of securities, improvement in trading practices, evolution of an efficient and transparent regulatory framework, emergence of several innovative financial products and services and specialized FIs etc.\\n\\nuse\\n\\nof\\n\\ninformation\\n\\nThese reforms were aimed at creating efficient and competitive securities market subject to effective regulation by SEBI, which would ensure investor protection.\\n\\nSecurities market in India has grown exponentially as measured in terms of amount raised from the market, number of stock exchanges and other intermediaries, the number of listed stocks, market capitalization, trading volumes and turnover on stock exchanges, investor population and price indices. Along with this, the profiles of the investors, issuers and intermediaries have changed significantly. The market has witnessed fundamental institutional changes resulting in drastic reduction in transaction costs and significant improvements in efficiency, transparency and safety, thanks to the National Stock Exchange. Indian market is now comparable to many developed markets in terms of a number of parameters.\\n\\nDevelopments\\t in\\t Securities\\t Markets,\\t before\\t 1992\\t and\\t present\\t scenario\\n\\nFeatures Regulator\\n\\nSecurities\\n\\nForm of securi- ties\\n\\nPre-1992 No specific regulator, but central govern- ment oversight\\n\\nLimited number of traditional instru- ments\\n\\nPhysical\\n\\nPresent scenario A specialized regulator for securities market (SEBI) created in 1992, vested with the powers to protect inves- tors’ interest and to develop and regulate securities mar- ket.

MONEY MARKET\\n\\nOne of the sections of a financial market where securities and financial instruments with short-term maturities are traded is called the money market. It deals in funds and financial instruments having a maturity period of one day to one year.\\n\\nFinancial assets like treasury bills, certificates of deposits, commercial paper and bankers’ acceptance are some of the short-term debt securities traded in the money market.\\n\\nRBI being the main constituent in the money market aims at ensuring that liquidity and short term interest rates are consistent with the monetary policy objectives. RBI describes money market as “the centre for dealings, mainly of a short-term character, in monetary assets, it meets the short-term requirements of borrowers and provides liquidity or cash to lenders”.\\n\\nThe money market functions are -\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfer of large sums of money\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfer from parties with surplus funds to parties with a deficit\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow governments to raise funds\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp to implement monetary policy\\n\\n\\n\\nDetermine short-term interest rates\\n\\nThe Indian money market consists of the unorganised sector: moneylenders, indigenous bankers, chit funds; organised sector: Reserve Bank of India, private banks, public sector banks, development banks and other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) such as Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the International Finance Corporation, IDBI, and the co-operative sector.\\n\\nMoney\\tmarket\\tand\\tCapital\\tMarket\\n\\nMoney Market is a place for short term lending and borrowing, typically within a year. It deals in short term debt financing and investments. On the other hand, Capital Market refers to stock market, which refers to trading in shares and bonds of companies on recognized stock exchanges. Individual players cannot invest in money market as the value of investments is large, on the other hand, in capital market, anybody can make investments through a broker. Stock Market is\\n\\n25\\n\\nassociated with high risk and high return as against money market which is more secure. Further, in case of money market, deals are transacted on phone or through electronic systems as against capital market where trading is through recognized stock exchanges.\\n\\nMoney\\tMarket\\tInstruments\\n\\n1)\\n\\nTreasury Bills (T-Bills)\\n\\nTreasury bills (T-bills) offer short-term investment opportunities, generally up to one year. They are thus useful in managing short-term liquidity. At present, the Government of India issues three types of treasury bills through auctions, namely, 91-day, 182-day and 364-day. There are no treasury bills issued by State Governments.\\n\\nTreasury bills are available for a minimum amount of Rs.25,000 and in multiples of Rs. 25,000. Treasury bills are issued at a discount and are redeemed at par. Treasury bills are also issued under the Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS).\\n\\n2)\\n\\nRepurchase Agreements\\n\\nRepurchase transactions, called Repo or Reverse Repo are transactions or short term loans in which two parties agree to sell and repurchase the same security. They are usually used transactions for overnight borrowing. Repo/Reverse Repo can be done only between the parties approved by RBI and in RBI approved securities viz. Government Of India and State Government Securities, T-Bills, PSU Bonds, FI Bonds, Corporate Bonds etc. Under repurchase agreement the seller sells specified securities with an agreement to repurchase the same at a mutually decided future date and price. Similarly, the buyer purchases the securities with an agreement to resell the same to the seller on an agreed date at a predetermined price. Such a transaction is called a Repo when viewed from the perspective of the seller of the securities and Reverse Repo when viewed from the perspective of the buyer of the securities.\\n\\n3)\\n\\nCommercial Papers (CP)\\n\\nCommercial Papers were introduced in January 1990. Commercial Papers can be issued by a listed company which have working capital of not less than Rs. 5 crores. They can be issued in multiple of Rs. 25 lakhs and the minimum size of issue being Rs. 1 crore. At present the maturity period of CPs ranges between 7 days to 1 year. CPs are issued at a discount to its face value and\\n\\n26\\n\\n4)\\n\\n5)\\n\\n6)\\n\\nredeemed at its face value.\\n\\nCertificate of Deposit (CD)\\n\\nCertificate of Deposit (CD) is a negotiable money market instrument and issued in dematerialised form or as a Usance Promissory Note against funds deposited at a bank or other eligible financial institution for a specified time period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by various directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as amended from time to time.\\n\\nMinimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh, i.e., the minimum deposit that could be accepted from a single subscriber should not be less than Rs.1 lakh, and in multiples of Rs. 1 lakh thereafter. The maturity period of CDs issued by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than one year, from the date of issue. The FIs (financial institutions) can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of issue.\\n\\nBanker’s Acceptance\\n\\nA banker’s acceptance is a short-term investment plan created by a company or firm with a guarantee from a bank. It is a guarantee from the bank that a buyer will pay the seller at a future date. A good credit rating is required by the company or firm drawing the bill. The terms for these instruments are usually 90 days, but this period can vary between 30 and 180 days. Companies use the acceptance as a time draft for financing imports, exports and other trade\\n\\nCommercial Bill\\n\\nCommercial bills are short term, negotiable and self liquidating money market instruments with low risk. A bill of exchange is drawn by a seller on the buyer to make payment within a certain period of time. Generally, the maturity period is of three months. Commercial bill can be resold a number of times during the usance period of bill. The commercial bills are purchased and discounted by commercial banks and are rediscounted by financial institutions.\\n\\n27\\n\\n4.\\n\\nCOMMODITY MARKET\\n\\nCommodity market is an important constituent of the financial markets of any country. It is the market where a wide range of products, viz., precious metals, base metals, crude oil, energy and soft commodities like palm oil, coffee etc. are traded. It is important to develop a vibrant, active and liquid commodity market. This would help investors hedge their commodity risk, take speculative positions in commodities and exploit arbitrage opportunities in the market.\\n\\nInvestors access about 50 major commodity markets worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries for price risk management.\\n\\nDerivatives such as futures contracts, Swaps, Exchange-traded Commodities, forward contracts etc. have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated commodities exchanges.\\n\\nThe regulatory body for commodity trading in India is the Forward Markets Commission.\\n\\nHistory\\tof\\tthe\\tCommodity\\tFutures\\tMarket\\tin\\tIndia\\n\\nThe Commodity Futures market in India dates back to more than a century. The first organized futures market was established in 1875, under the name of ’Bombay Cotton Trade Association’ to trade in cotton derivative contracts. This was followed by institutions for futures trading in oilseeds, foodgrains, etc. The futures market in India underwent rapid growth between the period of First and Second World War. As a result, before the outbreak of the Second World War, a large number of commodity exchanges trading futures contracts in several commodities like cotton, groundnut, groundnut oil, raw jute, jute goods, castorseed, wheat, rice, sugar, precious metals like gold and silver were flourishing throughout the country. In view of the delicate supply situation of major commodities in the backdrop of war efforts mobilization, futures trading came to be prohibited during the Second World War under the Defence of India Act. After Independence, especially in the second half of the\\n\\n28\\n\\n1950s and first half of 1960s, the commodity futures trading again picked up and there were thriving commodity markets. However, in mid-1960s, commodity futures trading in most of the commodities was banned and futures trading continued in two minor commodities, viz, pepper and turmeric.\\n\\nThe Khusro Committee (June 1980) had recommended reintroduction of futures trading in most of the major commodities , including cotton, kapas, raw jute and jute goods and suggested that steps may be taken for introducing futures trading in commodities, like potatoes, onions, etc. at appropriate time. The government, accordingly initiated futures trading in Potato during the latter half of 1980, in a few markets in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Futures trading were also resumed in castorseed, and gur (jaggery), and in 1992, extended to Hessian (Jute). After the introduction of economic reforms in June 1991 and the consequent trade and industry liberalization in both the domestic and external sectors, the Govt. of India appointed in June 1993, a committee on Forward Markets under the Chairmanship of Prof. K.N. Kabra. The Committee submitted its report in September 1994. The majority view of the Committee was that futures trading be introduced in Basmati Rice, Cotton and Kapas, Raw Jute and Jute Goods, Groundnut, rapeseed/ mustard seed, cottonseed, sesame seed, sunflower seed, safflower seed, copra and soybean oilseeds, oils and their oilcakes, Rice bran oil, Castor oil and its oilcake, Linseed, Silver and Onion. The Committee also recommended that some of the existing commodity exchanges particularly those with futures trading in pepper and castor seed, may be upgraded to the level of international futures markets. In April 1999, futures trading was permitted in various edible oilseed complexes.\\n\\nThe National Agriculture Policy announced in July 2000 and the announcements of Hon’ble Finance Minister in the Budget Speech for 2002-2003 indicated the Government’s resolve to put in place a mechanism of futures trade/market. Futures trading in sugar was permitted in May 2001 and the Government issued notifications on 1.4.2003 permitting futures trading in all the commodities. With the issue of these notifications, futures trading is not prohibited in any commodity.\\n\\n29\\n\\n5.\\n\\nFORWARD MARKET\\n\\nThe forward market is the informal over-the-counter financial market by which contracts for future delivery are entered into. Standardized forward contracts are called futures contracts and traded on a futures exchange. Forward markets are used for trading a range of instruments including currencies and interest rates, as well as assets such as commodities and securities.\\n\\nIt\\tshould\\tnot\\tbe\\tconfused\\twith\\tthe\\tfutures\\tmarket,\\tas\\t–\\n\\n\\n\\nFuture contracts are traded in exchanges whereas a forward Contract is traded over the counter.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe forward market is highly customized.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough the forward market is not exchange traded, chances of parties defaulting are very low.\\n\\nA forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset (which can be of any kind) at a pre-agreed future point in time. Therefore, the trade date and delivery date are separated. It is used to control and hedge risk, for example currency exposure risk (e.g., forward contracts on USD or EURO) or commodity prices (e.g., forward contracts on oil). One party agrees (obligated) to sell, the other to buy, for a forward price agreed in advance. In a forward transaction, no actual cash changes hands. If the transaction is collateralized, exchange of margin will take place according to a pre-agreed rule or schedule. Otherwise no asset of any kind actually changes hands, until the maturity of the contract. The forward price of such a contract is commonly contrasted with the spot price, which is the price at which the asset changes hands (on the spot date, usually two business days). The difference between the spot and the forward price is the forward premium or forward discount.\\n\\n5.1.\\tForward\\tContracts\\t(Regulation)\\tAct,\\t1952\\n\\nThe Forward Contracts Regulation Act provides for the regulation of commodity futures markets in India and the establishment of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC). The Forward Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1954 has been issued under the Act.\\n\\nThe need for regulation arises on account of the fact that the benefits of futures markets accrue in competitive conditions. The regulation is\\n\\n30\\n\\nneeded to create competitive conditions. In the absence of regulation, unscrupulous participants could use these leveraged contracts for manipulating prices. This could have undesirable influence on the spot prices, thereby affecting interests of society at large. Regulation is also needed to ensure that the market has appropriate risk management system. In the absence of such a system, a major default could create a chain reaction. The resultant financial crisis in a futures market could create systematic risk. Regulation is also needed to ensure fairness and transparency in trading, clearing, settlement and management of the exchange so as to protect and promote the interest of various stakeholders, particularly non-member users of the market.\\n\\n“Forward contract” means a contract for the delivery of goods and which is not a ready delivery contract. “Goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims, money and securities.\\n\\nUnder the Act, only those associations/exchanges, which are granted recognition by the Government, are allowed to organize forward trading in regulated commodities. The Act envisages three-tier regulation: (i) The Exchange which organizes forward trading in commodities can regulate trading on a day-to-day basis; (ii) the Forward Markets Commission provides regulatory oversight under the powers delegated to it by the central Government, and (iii) the Central Government.\\n\\nUnder Section 15, Government has powers to notify commodities in which forward trading is regulated as also the area in which such regulation will be in force. Once a commodity is notified under section 15, the forward trading in such contracts has to be necessarily between members of the recognized association or through or with any such member. Contracts other than these are illegal.\\n\\nUnder Section 17, the Government has powers to notify commodities, forward trading in which is prohibited in whole or part of India. Any forward trading in such commodities in the notified area is illegal and liable to penal action.\\n\\nThe following persons can be arrested and prosecuted under the Act, 1952:\\n\\n\\n\\nOwner or tenant of a place which is used, with the knowledge of such owner and tenant, for entering into or making or performing, whether completely or in part, illegal forward contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nA person who, without permission of the Central Government,\\n\\n31\\n\\norganizes or assists in organizing or becomes a member of any association other than recognized association for the purpose of assisting in, entering into or making or performing, whether completely or in part, illegal forward contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who controls, manages, or assists in keeping any place, other than recognized association for entering into, or making, or performing illegal forward contract, or for clearing or settlement of such contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who deliberately misrepresents or persuades any person to believe that he is a member of a recognized association or that forward contract can be entered into or made or performed, whether completely or in part, through him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who is not a member of a recognized association canvasses, advertises or touts in any business connected with forward contracts in contravention of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who joins, gathers, or assists in gathering at any place other than the place of business specified in the bye-laws of the recognized associations for making bids or offers or for entering into illegal forward contracts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who makes publishes or circulates any statement or information, which is false and which he either knows, or believes to be false, affecting or tending to affect the course of business in forward contracts in permitted commodities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAny person who manipulates or attempts to manipulate prices of forward contracts in permitted commodities are liable for punishment under the Act on conviction.\\n\\n5.2.\\tForward\\tMarkets\\tCommission\\n\\nThe Forward Markets Commission (FMC) is a statutory body set up under the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. It functions under the administrative control of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance since September 2013. (Before this, FMC used to function under Department of Consumer Affairs, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution, Govt. of India. It has its headquarters at Mumbai and one regional office at Kolkata. The Commission comprises of a Chairman, and two Members. It is organized into five administrative divisions to carry out various tasks.\\n\\nForward Markets Commission provides regulatory oversight in order\\n\\n32\\n\\nto ensure financial integrity (i.e. to prevent systematic risk of default by one major operator or group of operators), market integrity (i.e. to ensure that futures prices are truly aligned with the prospective demand and supply conditions) and to protect & promote interest of consumers /non-members. The Forward Markets Commission performs the role of a market regulator. After assessing the market situation and taking into account the recommendations made by the Board of Directors of the Commodity Exchange, the Commission approves the rules and regulations of the Exchange in accordance with which trading is to be conducted. It accords permission for commencement of trading in different contracts, monitors market conditions continuously and takes remedial measures wherever necessary by imposing various regulatory measures.\\n\\nOut of 19 recognized exchanges, Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX), Mumbai; National Multi Commodities Exchange, (NMCE), Ahmedabad; ACE Derivatives and Commodity Exchange, Mumbai; Indian Commodity Exchange, Ltd., Mumbai; are the major exchanges in India.\\n\\nFunctions\\tof\\tthe\\tForward\\tMarkets\\tCommission\\tare\\t–\\n\\n(a) To advise the Central Government in respect of the recognition or the withdrawal of recognition from any association or in respect of any other matter arising out of the administration of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act 1952.\\n\\n(b) To keep forward markets under observation and to take such action in relation to them, as it may consider necessary, in exercise of the powers assigned to it by or under the Act.\\n\\n(c) To collect and whenever the Commission thinks it necessary, to publish information regarding the trading conditions in respect of goods to which any of the provisions of the act is made applicable, including information regarding supply, demand and prices, and to submit to the Central Government, periodical reports on the working of forward markets relating to such goods;\\n\\n(d) To make recommendations generally with a view to improving the\\n\\norganization and working of forward markets;\\n\\n(e) To undertake the inspection of the accounts and other documents of any recognized association or registered association or any member of such association whenever it considerers it necessary.\\n\\n33\\n\\n(f)\\n\\nTo perform such other duties and exercise such other powers as may be assigned to the Commission by or under this Act, or as may be prescribed.\\n\\nList\\tof\\tExchanges\\n\\nA.

The underlying asset can be securities, commodities, bullion, currency, live stock or anything else. In other words, Derivative means a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfillment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities.\\n\\nIndia’s tryst with derivatives began in 2000 when both the NSE and the BSE commenced trading in equity derivatives. In June 2000, index futures became the first type of derivate instruments to be launched in the Indian markets, followed by index options in June 2001, options in individual stocks in July 2001, and futures in single stock derivatives in November 2001. Since then, equity derivatives have come a long way. New products, an expanding list of eligible investors, rising volumes, and the best risk management framework for exchange-traded derivatives have been the hallmark of the journey of equity derivatives in India so far.\\n\\nDerivatives markets broadly can be classified into two categories, those that are traded on the exchange and those traded one to one or ‘over the counter’. They are hence known as:\\n\\n\\n\\nExchange Traded Derivatives\\n\\n\\n\\nOTC Derivatives (Over The Counter)\\n\\n\\n\\nOTC Equity Derivatives\\n\\nDerivative trading in India takes can place either on a separate and independent Derivative Exchange or on a separate segment of an existing Stock Exchange. Derivative Exchange/Segment function as a Self-Regulatory Organisation and SEBI acts as the oversight regulator. The clearing & settlement of all trades on the Derivative Exchange/Segment would have to be through a Clearing Corporation/ House, which is independent in governance and membership from the Derivative Exchange/Segment. Derivatives trading take place under the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992.\\n\\nThe term Derivative has been defined in Securities Contracts (Regulations) Act, as:-\\n\\n35\\n\\n“A Derivative includes: -\\n\\na. a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan, whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security;\\n\\nb. a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of\\n\\nprices, of underlying securities;”\\n\\nDerivative products have been introduced in a phased manner starting with Index Futures Contracts in June 2000. Index Options and Stock Options were introduced in June 2001 and July 2001 followed by Stock Futures in November 2001. Sectoral indices were permitted for derivatives trading in December 2002. During December 2007 SEBI permitted mini derivative (F&O) contract on Index (Sensex and Nifty). Further, in January 2008, longer tenure Index options contracts and Volatility Index and in April 2008, Bond Index was introduced. In addition to the above, during August 2008, SEBI permitted Exchange traded Currency Derivatives.\\n\\nMeasures\\tspecified\\tby\\tSEBI\\tto\\tprotect\\tthe\\trights\\tof\\tinvestor\\tin\\t Derivatives\\tMarket\\tare\\t–\\n\\na.\\n\\nInvestor’s money has to be kept separate at all levels and is permitted to be used only against the liability of the Investor and is not available to the trading member or clearing member or even any other investor.\\n\\nb.\\n\\nThe Trading Member is required to provide every investor with a risk disclosure document which will disclose the risks associated with the derivatives trading so that investors can take a conscious decision to trade in derivatives.\\n\\nc.\\n\\nInvestor would get the contract note duly time stamped for receipt of the order and execution of the order.

Whereas the financial system performed this role reasonably well, its operations came to be marked by some serious deficiencies over the years. The banking sector suffered from lack of competition, low capital base, low productivity and high intermediation cost.\\n\\nAfter the nationalization of large banks in 1969 and 1980, public ownership dominated the banking sector. The role of technology was minimal and the quality of service was not given adequate importance. Banks also did not follow proper risk management system and the prudential standards were weak. All these resulted in poor asset quality and low profitability.\\n\\nAmong non-banking financial intermediaries, development finance institutions (DFIs) operated in an over-protected environment with most of the funding coming from assured sources at concessional terms. In the insurance sector, there was little competition. The mutual fund industry also suffered from lack of competition and was dominated for long by one institution, viz., the Unit Trust of India. Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) grew rapidly, but there was no regulation of their asset side. Financial markets were characterized by control over pricing of financial assets, barriers to entry, high transaction costs and restrictions on movement of funds/participants between the market segments. Apart from inhibiting the development of the markets, this also affected their efficiency.\\n\\nAgainst this backdrop, wide-ranging financial sector reforms in India were introduced as an integral part of the economic reforms initiated in the early 1990s. Financial sector reforms in India were grounded in the belief that competitive efficiency in the real sectors of the economy will not be realized to its full potential unless the financial sector was reformed as well. Thus, the principal objective of financial sector reforms was to improve the allocative efficiency of resources and accelerate the growth process of the real sector by removing structural deficiencies affecting the performance of financial institutions and financial markets.\\n\\nThe main thrust of reforms in the financial sector was on the creation of efficient and stable financial institutions and markets. Reforms in respect of the banking as well as non-banking financial institutions\\n\\n38\\n\\nfocused on creating a deregulated environment and enabling free play of market forces while at the same time strengthening the prudential norms and the supervisory system. In the banking sector, the focus was on imparting operational flexibility and functional autonomy with a view to enhancing efficiency, productivity and profitability, imparting strength to the system and ensuring accountability and financial soundness. The restrictions on activities undertaken by the existing institutions were gradually relaxed and barriers to entry in the banking sector were removed.\\n\\nIn the case of non-banking financial intermediaries, reforms focused on removing sector-specific deficiencies. Thus, while reforms in respect of DFIs focused on imparting market orientation to their operations by withdrawing assured sources of funds, in the case of NBFCs, the reform measures brought their asset side also under the regulation of the Reserve Bank. In the case of the insurance sector and mutual funds, reforms attempted to create a competitive environment by allowing private sector participation.\\n\\nReforms in financial markets focused on removal of structural bottlenecks, introduction of new players/instruments, free pricing of financial assets, relaxation of quantitative restrictions improvement in trading, clearing and settlement practices, more transparency, etc. Reforms encompassed regulatory and legal changes, building of institutional infrastructure, refinement of market microstructure and technological up gradation. In the various financial market segments, reforms aimed at creating liquidity and depth and an efficient price discovery process.\\n\\nReforms in the commercial banking sector had two distinct phases. The first phase of reforms, introduced subsequent to the release of the Report of the Committee on Financial System, 1992 (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham), focused mainly on enabling and strengthening measures. The second phase of reforms, introduced subsequent to the recommendations of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms, 1998 (Chairman: Shri M. Narasimham) placed greater emphasis on structural measures and improvement in standards of disclosure and levels of transparency in order to align the Indian standards with international best practices.\\n\\nDuring the last four decades, particularly after the first phase of nationalization of banks in 1969, there have been distinct improvements in the banking activities which strengthened the financial intermediation\\n\\n39\\n\\nprocess. The total number of offices of public sector banks which was merely at 8262 in June 1969 increased to 62,607 as of June 2011. Similarly, there have been many fold increases in aggregate deposits and credit indicating existence of a vibrant bank-based financial system.\\n\\nFirst, an important indicator of bank-based financial deepening, i.e Private sector credit has expanded rapidly in the past five decades thereby supporting the growth momentum. Second, financial innovations have influenced velocity circulation of money by both reducing the transaction costs and enhancing the liquidity of financial assets. A relatively increasing value of velocity could be seen as a representative indicator of an efficient financial sector. In case of India, the velocity circulation of broad money has fallen since 1970s partly reflecting the fact that, in the midst of crisis, money injected to the system could not get distributed efficiently from the banking system to non-banks. Sharper fall in the velocity of narrow money reflected reluctance among banks as well as the public to part with liquidity. Third, the market-based indicator of financial deepening, i.e., market capitalization-to-GDP ratio has increased very sharply in the past two decades implying for a vibrant capital market in India. Various reform measures undertaken since the early 1990s by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Government of India have brought about a significant structural transformation in the Indian capital market. Although the Indian equity market has become modern and transparent, its role in capital formation continues to be limited. Unlike in some advanced economies, the primary equity and debt markets in India have not yet fully developed. The size of the public issue segment has remained small as corporate have tended to prefer the international capital market and the private placement market. The private corporate debt market is active mainly in the form of private placements.\\n\\nHowever, the domestic credit provided by the Indian banks still remains at an abysmally low as compared with major emerging market and developing economies (EDEs) and advanced economies. Furthermore, the level of credit disbursement is also far below the world average levels. Therefore, there is scope for the Indian banks to expand their business to important productive sectors of the economy.\\n\\nIndia weathered the disruptions in the global financial system mainly due to a robust regulatory and supervisory framework, limited openness and global exposure of banking system with timely policy actions especially to manage liquidity. It was, however, acknowledged\\n\\n40\\n\\nthat financial sector reforms has to keep progressing with continued improvements in regulation, supervision and stability areas in order to avoid build up of new vulnerabilities. The global financial crisis provided a renewed impetus to the second generation financial sector reforms in India whose major components could be identified as: (i) adherence to international standards, especially implementing G20 commitments; (ii) developmental measures; and (iii) stability measures..\\n\\nAgainst the backdrop of a felt need that the legal and institutional structure of the Financial sector in India need to be reviewed and recast in tune with the contemporary requirements of the sector, The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), headed by Justice B.N. Srikrishna, was set up by Ministry of Finance in March 2011 to review, simplify and rewrite the legal and institutional structures of the financial sector.\\n\\n41\\n\\n8. COMMISSION\\t(FSLRC)\\n\\nFINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATIVE REFORMS\\n\\nThe Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) was constituted by the Government of India, Ministry of Finance; vide resolution dated 24th March 2011. The setting up of the FSLRC was the result of a felt need that the legal and institutional structures of the financial sector in India need to be reviewed and recast in tune with the contemporary requirements of the sector.\\n\\nThe institutional framework governing the financial sector has been built up over a century. There are over 60 Acts and multiple rules and regulations that govern the financial sector. Many of the financial sector laws date back several decades, when the financial landscape was very different from that seen today. For example, the RBI Act and the Insurance Act are of 1934 and 1938 vintage respectively. The Securities Contract Regulation Act was enacted in 1956, when derivatives and statutory regulators were unknown. The superstructure of the financial sector governance regime has been modified in a piecemeal fashion from time to time, without substantial changes to the underlying foundations. These piecemeal changes have induced complex and cumbersome legislation, and raised difficulties in harmonising contradictory provisions. Such harmonisation is imperative for effectively regulating a dynamic market in the era of financial globalisation.\\n\\nThe piecemeal amendments have generated unintended outcomes including regulatory gaps, overlaps, inconsistencies and regulatory arbitrage. The fragmented regulatory architecture has led to a loss of scale and scope that could be available from a seamless financial market with all its attendant benefits of minimising the intermediation cost. For instance, complex financial intermediation by financial conglomerates of today falls under the purview of multiple regulators with gaps and overlaps. A number of expert committees have pointed out these discrepancies, and recommended the need for revisiting the financial sector legislations to rectify them. The need for complete review of the existing financial sector laws has been underlined to make the Indian financial sector more vibrant and dynamic in an increasingly interconnected world.\\n\\nThe\\tremit\\tof\\tFSLRC,\\tas\\tcontained\\tin\\tits\\tTerms\\tof\\tReference\\t(ToR),\\t comprises\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nReview, simplify and rewrite the legislations affecting the financial\\n\\n42\\n\\nmarkets in India, focussing on broad principles.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nEvolve a common set of principles for governance of financial sector regulatory institutions.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRemove inconsistencies and uncertainties in legislations/Rules and Regulations.\\n\\n4. Make legislations consistent with each other.\\n\\n5. Make legislations dynamic to automatically bring them in tune with the changing financial landscape.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nStreamline the regulatory architecture of financial markets.\\n\\nBased on substantive research, extensive deliberations the Commission and in its Working Groups, interaction with policy makers, regulators, experts and stakeholders; the Commission evolved a tentative framework on the legal–institutional structure required for the Indian financial sector in the medium to the long run. The broad contour of that framework was outlined in the Approach Paper released by the Commission in October 2012.\\n\\nin\\n\\nThe\\tApproach\\tPaper\\temphasised\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\n\\n\\nA uniform legal process for the financial sector regulators emphasising rule of law.\\n\\n\\n\\nA well-articulated principles-based approach to primary legislation emphasising a sound body of subordinate legislation based on these laws.\\n\\n\\n\\nStatutorily empowered, independent regulators with clear goals, powers and accountability.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemoving twilight zones in the financial sector: every entity operating in the financial space needs to be on the radar of a financial regulator.\\n\\n\\n\\nFocusing on consumer protection - This is the ultimate objective of financial sector regulation as regulation per se is not an objective. Consumer protection has two components; prevention and cure. While financial regulators will address the former, the proposed financial redressal agency (FRA) spanning across the financial sector will deal with the latter addressing financial consumer grievances. A feed-back loop from the FRA to the regulators will help the latter in systemically addressing consumer grievances by appropriate regulations.\\n\\n\\n\\nA resolution mechanism to address failure of financial firms and\\n\\n43\\n\\nto protect consumers, including management of the deposit insurance scheme.\\n\\n\\n\\nOwnership neutrality and competition.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoving away from the sectoral approach to regulation.\\n\\n\\n\\nA framework for addressing systemic risk, financial sector development, coordination etc.\\n\\n8.1.\\tFSLRC\\tReport\\t–\\tVolume\\tI\\t&\\tII\\n\\nSubsequent to the approach paper, the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission headed by Chairman Justice B.N.Srikrishna submitted a two volume report to the Ministry of Finance in March 2013, with its recommendations on the legal and institutional framework for the future of India’s financial system.\\n\\nThe main outcome of the Commission’s work is a draft ‘Indian Financial Code’ which is non-sectoral in nature, which is in Volume II of the report and replaces the bulk of the existing financial law. Volume 1 expresses the arguments that led up to the key decisions embedded in the draft Code.\\n\\nThe\\tCommission\\tidentified\\tnine\\tcomponents\\tof\\tfocus\\tfor\\tfinancial\\t law:\\n\\ni.\\n\\nconsumer protection,\\n\\nii. micro-prudential regulation,\\n\\niii.\\n\\nresolution,\\n\\niv.\\n\\ncapital controls,\\n\\nv.\\n\\nsystemic risk,\\n\\nvi.\\n\\ndevelopment and redistribution,\\n\\nvii. monetary policy,\\n\\nviii. public debt management and\\n\\nix.\\n\\ncontracts trading & market abuse.\\n\\nUnder the proposed regulatory architecture, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Forward Markets Commission (FMC), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) would be merged into a new unified agency.\\n\\n44\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank, however, will continue to exist with modified functions, said the two-volume report of the Commission.\\n\\nIt said the existing Securities Appellate Tribunal be subsumed into Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT).\\n\\nIt also suggested that Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) be given statutory framework.\\n\\nThe panel also suggested setting up of a new Debt Management Office (DMO) and also subsuming the existing Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC) into the Resolution Corporation.\\n\\n“The Commission believes that this proposed financial regulatory architecture is a modest step away from present practice, embeds important improvements, and will serve India well in coming years,” the Commission said.\\n\\nAccording to the Commission, the actual functioning of the regulator lies in three areas -- regulation-making, executive functions and administrative law functions.\\n\\nWith regard to capital control, the report said the Finance Ministry should make rules for inbound capital flows, while the onus of making rules for outbound capital flows should rest with the RBI.\\n\\n“At present, in India, there is a confusing situation with regulators utilising many instruments such as regulations, guidelines, circulars, letters, notices and press releases. The draft Code requires all regulators to operate through a small number of well defined instruments only,” it said. It said, in an emergency the regulator can issue regulations. However, these regulations would lapse within six months.\\n\\nThe\\tCommission\\thas\\tproposed\\ta\\tfinancial\\tregulatory\\tarchitecture\\t featuring\\tseven\\tagencies\\t–\\n\\ni.\\n\\nThe existing RBI will continue to exist, though with modified functions.\\n\\nii.\\n\\nThe existing SEBI, FMC, IRDA and PFRDA will be merged into a new unified agency.\\n\\niii.\\n\\nThe existing Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) will be subsumed\\n\\n45\\n\\ninto the FSAT.\\n\\niv.\\n\\nThe existing Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of the Resolution Corporation.\\n\\nIndia (DICGC) will be subsumed\\n\\ninto\\n\\nv.\\n\\nA new Financial Redressal Agency (FRA) will be created.\\n\\nvi.\\n\\nA new Debt Management Office will be created.\\n\\nvii. The existing FSDC will continue to exist, though with modified\\n\\nfunctions and a statutory framework.\\n\\nThe Commission has recommended the repeal or large scale amendment of all special legislations that (a) establish statutory financial institutions; or (b) lay down specific provisions to govern any aspect of the operation or functioning of public sector financial institutions. The undertakings of all statutory institutions should be transferred to ordinary companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and their regulatory treatment should be identical as that applicable to all other financial companies.\\n\\n8.2.\\tDraft\\tIndian\\tFinancial\\tCode,\\t2013\\n\\nThe draft Indian Financial Code submitted by the FSLRC contains 450 clauses under 15 Parts and 87 chapters with 6 schedules. It is a single unified and internally consistent draft law that replaces a large part of the existing Indian legal framework governing finance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe draft Code does not differentiate between different sectors in the financial system, the draft Code establishes a single framework for regulatory governance across all agencies.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt creates a series of obligations for the Government and for regulators.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe draft Code covers all functions of regulators, and defines the behaviour that is required from the regulator.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt establishes certain elements of the functioning of board meetings, so as to ensure adequate oversight of the board over the organisation, and an emphasis on transparency.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt present, in India, there is a confusing situation with regulators utilising many instruments such as regulations, guidelines, circulars, letters, notices and press releases. The draft Code requires all regulators to operate through a small number of well defined instruments only.\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\nThe draft Code has specifics about each element of the executive powers. The first stage is the processing of permissions. A systematic process has been laid down through which permissions would be given.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe draft Code has a systematic approach where certain standard categories are defined, and principles guide the application of penalties. This would help induce greater consistency, and help produce greater deterrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nA critical component of the framework for penalties is the mechanisms for compounding, which are laid on a sound foundation, and consistently applied across the entire financial system.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt establishes certain basic rights for all financial consumers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Commission envisages a unified Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT) that would hear all appeals in finance. A considerable focus has been placed, in the draft Code, on the functioning of the registry of FSAT, so as to achieve high efficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe part on establishment of financial regulatory agencies provides for the creation of five new statutory bodies - UFA, Resolution Corporation, FRA, PDMA and FSAT. This part also provides for the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the two financial sector regulators - UFA and RBI.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe draft Code however revisits the functions and powers of RBI, and sets out the manner in which it must be operated and governed. Similarly, in case of FSDC, the existing FSDC is to be recast as a statutory body.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe remaining provisions of the draft Code lay down the powers and functions of these statutory bodies and the principles and processes to govern the exercise of their powers.\\n\\nThe\\tCode\\tenvisages\\tthe\\testablishment\\tof\\tthe\\tfollowing\\tagencies\\n\\n1)\\n\\nUnified Financial Authority (UFA)\\n\\n2)\\n\\nReserve Bank of India (RBI)\\n\\n3)\\n\\nFinancial Redress Agency (FRA)\\n\\n4)\\n\\nResolution Corporation\\n\\n5)\\n\\nFinancial Stability & Development Council (FSDC)\\n\\n6)\\n\\nPublic Debt Management Agency (PDMA)\\n\\n47\\n\\n7)\\n\\nFinancial Sector Appellate Tribunal (FSAT)\\n\\nThe Code covers all functions of the regulator and lays down the principles and standards of behaviour expected from the regulator. It also provides for a system of monitoring the functions of the regulator with a process to ensure that the regulator is fully transparent and they act in compliance with the best practices of public administration. The Commission felt that the structure of the regulator should be standardised for all financial regulators except for certain exemptions where the general regulatory processes may not apply. These exceptions to the general process law should be kept to the minimum and generally avoided.\\n\\nThe consumer protection part of the Code has three components: an enumerated set of rights and protections for consumers, an enumerated set of powers in the hands of the regulator, and principles that guide what power should be used under what circumstances. The details of consumer protection would, of course, lie in the subordinated legislation to be drafted by financial regulators. The Commission felt that an overarching principle based body of law would allow regulatory flexibility, consistent treatment of consumers across all aspects of their engagement with the financial system, fairness and ultimately a more stable financial system. The basic objective of consumer protection is to guard consumer interests and to promote public awareness. While pursuing these objectives, the regulator will be empowered to make regulations to determine the manner and extent to which the protections under the law will apply to the users of different financial products and services.\\n\\nThe\\tdraft\\tCode\\taddresses\\tfundamental\\tconcerns\\tin\\tthe\\tframework\\t of\\tcapital\\tcontrols,\\tand\\tprovides\\tfor\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe rules on capital account transactions for all inbound flows including outflows that arise as a consequence of these inflows, will be made by the Central Government in consultation with the RBI. The regulations on capital account transactions for all outbound flows will be made by the RBI in consultation with the Central Government.\\n\\n2. A single investment vehicle for investment in India i.e., qualified foreign investors (those foreign investors who meet the customer due diligence criteria prescribed by the Central Government);\\n\\n3. A sound legal process while making rules for capital account transactions and while granting approvals;\\n\\n48\\n\\n4. A framework for imposition of controls in emergency situations (such as war, natural calamity and balance of payment crises);\\n\\n5. Review or restrictions on capital account transactions on national security considerations, by the Central Government or the RBI for inbound and outbound flows, respectively;\\n\\n6. Review of decisions of the Central Government and the RBI; and\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe principle that once controls are imposed at the entry level there must be equal treatment for Indian investors and foreign investors.\\n\\nEnsuring compliance of provisions on capital controls in the draft Code, rules and regulations in relation to the capital controls is placed with the RBI in the draft Code. This would include oversight of reporting of foreign exchange transactions with the FDMC and ensuring compliance of the law, rules and regulations. Under conditions of full capital account convertibility, these functions will be placed with the Central Government.\\n\\nThe governance and operations of the public debt management agency would be handled through a two-tiered arrangement. At the top, there would be an advisory council, comprising of experts in finance, law, and public debt management. The advisory council must advise and issue opinions on any matter related to the objectives and functions of the public debt management agency that is referred to it by the agency or the Central Government. It must also advise and provide its opinion on the financing plans submitted by the public debt management agency to the Central Government, as well as the agency’s annual report, whenever such opinion is sought. The council must meet periodically to review and ratify the borrowing programme for the upcoming months. The main benefit of an independent public debt management agency will come through the integration of public debt management functions and various databases and information, which are currently dispersed. By unifying the public debt management function, and efficiently linking it with the cash and the investment management functions, there will be improved information, analysis and thus decision making. With specialised human resources at its disposal, the public debt management agency can contribute to a more effective interface with the market resulting in Cost-efficient management of Government borrowings. A specialised, unified and independent agency will have significant comparative advantage over the existing structure of a fractured and uncoordinated Government borrowing programme spread across various agencies.\\n\\n49\\n\\nFollowing\\tis\\ta\\tlist\\tof\\tlegislations\\tto\\tbe\\trepealed:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe Depositories Act, 1996\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe Public Debt Act, 1944\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe Government Securities Act, 2006\\n\\n6.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934\\n\\n7.\\n\\nThe Insurance Act, 1938\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe Banking Regulation Act, 1949\\n\\n9.\\n\\nThe Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952\\n\\n10.

The IFC, establishes sound public administration and rule of law, and focuses financial agencies towards addressing market failures in the financial sector.\\n\\nIn its Eighth Meeting, the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) decided, inter alia that, “all the financial sector regulators (including FMC) will finalise an action plan for implementation of all the FSLRC principles relating to regulatory governance, transparency and 50\\n\\nimproved operational efficiency that do not require legislative action.”\\n\\nThe FSDC accordingly approved twelve steps (and one item on the early implementation of these steps) that each regulator will take for the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, that would enhance governance, and not require legislative action at present. This is given in the ‘Handbook on adoption of governance enhancing and non- legislative elements of the draft Indian Financial Code’.\\n\\n1)\\n\\nConsumer Protection\\n\\nThe vulnerability of consumers reflects a major gap in Indian financial regulation. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC) has recommended the adoption of a consolidated consumer protection framework for the entire financial system that will empower and require regulators to pursue consumer protection for the financial activities under their jurisdiction. It has recommended legislative action on two fronts: prevention and cure.\\n\\nPrevention requires regulation-making and enforcement across the entire financial system from the viewpoint of consumer interests. For example, regulation may prohibit use of certain unfair terms of contract, which unreasonably favor the financial service provider at the expense of consumers.\\n\\nCure to effective grievance redress mechanisms. The Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, has recommended a two-tiered system of grievance redress. First, there should be mandated grievance redress mechanism within each financial service provider. Second, it has recommended an Ombudsman- like mechanism to redress consumer grievances.\\n\\nrequires providing consumers access\\n\\n2)\\n\\nConsumer Protection for Retail Consumers\\n\\nThe Report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, report recommends giving certain rights and protections to retail consumers. Retail consumers are individuals and small organisations.\\n\\nIt\\tis\\tenvisaged\\tthat\\tthe\\tregulators\\twill\\tspecify\\tby\\tregulation:\\n\\n1. A cap on the value of the financial product or financial service, below which a consumer is considered a retail consumer; and\\n\\n51\\n\\n2. A cap on the net asset value or turnover for organisations, below which such organisations may be considered retail consumers, as long as the value of the financial product or financial service they are availing or looking to avail is less than the cap specified above. Every regulator should specify these caps to create a category of retail consumers in the specific sector(s) it is regulating. Framing Regulations\\n\\nThe FSLRC Analysis and Recommendations, lays down the key features of the desired regulation making system, which are:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe regulator will have to publish the following documents in the process of formulating new regulations:\\n\\n(a) Draft regulations;\\n\\n(b) Jurisdiction clause to identify the legal provision under which the proposed regulations are being made, and the manner in which the regulation is consistent with the principles in the concerned legislation(s). If the parent legislation does not specifically refer to the subject matter of regulations, the regulator will have to establish a logical connection between the subject matter and the empowering provision in the law;\\n\\n(c) A statement of the problem or market failure that the regulator seeks to address through the proposed regulations, which will be used to test the effectiveness with which the regulations address the stated problem. The statement must contain: (a) The principles governing the proposed regulations; and (b) The outcome the regulator seeks to achieve through the regulation; and\\n\\n(d) An analysis of the costs and benefits of the proposed regulation. This is required because every regulatory intervention imposes certain costs on regulated entities and the system as a whole.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe Commission recommends that regulations be drafted in a manner that minimises these compliance costs. In some cases where a pure numerical value based cost-benefit analysis is not possible, the regulator should provide the best possible analysis and reasoning for its choice of intervention.\\n\\n3. After publishing the above documents, the regulator will specify a designated time for receiving comments from the public on the regulations and the accompanying documents.\\n\\n52\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe draft Code will ensure that the time period and the mode of participation specified by the regulator is appropriate to allow for widespread public participation.\\n\\n4)\\n\\nNotices\\n\\nOne of the steps the IFC, takes to ensure transparency and accountability is by requiring the standardisation of notices sent to regulated entities. The serving of a notice fulfills one of the requirements of the principles of natural justice. It seeks to give the recipient necessary information to respond to a regulator effectively, in order to defend his/her actions.\\n\\n5)\\n\\nTransparency\\n\\nTransparency refers to the practice of disclosing appropriate information to the public about the workings of an organisation, including the decision making processes as well as outcomes.\\n\\nThe\\tprovisions\\tof\\tthe\\tIFC,\\tregarding\\ttransparency\\tare:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDefinition of the term ‘publish’.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe process of making regulations, and requiring publication of drafts of proposed regulations;\\n\\n3.\\n\\nPublication of general and special guidance;\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe requirement that a mandatory review of all regulations take place periodically, and the result of the review be published;\\n\\n5.\\n\\nThe publication of comments received during the rulemaking process; and\\n\\n6.\\n\\nThe minimum standard for publication of information.\\n\\n6)\\n\\nTransparency in Board Meetings\\n\\nTransparency in board meetings refers to the practice of allowing public scrutiny of the work of the board’s crucial functions.\\n\\nThe boards of regulators have a critical role in ensuring good governance in the financial system, both by ensuring that best practices apply to regulators, and by creating a regulatory environment where good governance norms are upheld. Given this central role of boards, the FSLRC Analysis and Recommendations, has made explicit reference to the need for transparency in board meetings.\\n\\n53\\n\\n7)\\n\\nReporting\\n\\nReporting refers to the practice of measuring, recording and publishing data and information about an organisation’s activities, measured against the organisation’s objectives.\\n\\nEffective reporting results in immediate and clear benefits to regulated entities and consumers. When regulators declare how they intend to perform their functions and fulfill their objectives in their reports, regulated entities better understand the nature and context of regulation imposed on them. This helps regulated entities to account for compliance costs. It also makes regulatory action more predictable and consistent, thereby increasing its legitimacy.\\n\\n8)\\n\\nApprovals\\n\\nApprovals refer to the permissions granted by regulators and government to carry out any regulated activity. Committing to a time-bound approval process increases predictability, and this helps firms to rationally plan for rollout of products and services. Commitment to clear service-level targets also lowers administrative and compliance costs, since time- consuming status checks and follow-up calls become unnecessary.\\n\\n9)\\n\\nInvestigation\\n\\nInvestigation refers to the process by which the regulator determines if there has been a violation of an provision of the law or subordinate regulation that the regulator enforces.\\n\\nThe rule of law in the financial sector would be further enhanced where regulators assign investigative duties to specialized staff, who are not involved making a final evaluation as to whether a violation has occurred, and what penalties to impose. This is already being done by most regulators. The IFC, however requires clearer structure to the investigative process. The investigating staff would present the results of their investigation to a separate cell or specialized group within the regulatory body, whose job it is to determine violations and penalties.\\n\\n10)\\t Adjudication\\n\\nBoth regulators and regulated entities benefit when adjudicatory decisions are viewed as legitimate, are easy to understand, and\\n\\n54\\n\\nserve as guidance to other parties in the future. For this reason, the adjudication process should mandate that adjudicatory decisions be accompanied by a reasoned opinion. An effective, transparent, fair adjudication process, accompanied by clear, well-reasoned decisions, is a critical mechanism for removing regulatory uncertainty.\\n\\n11)\\n\\nImposition\\tof\\tPenalty\\n\\nWhile making regulations on the imposition of penalties in a proportional manner, regulators must consider the following factors (in addition to existing law):\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe nature and seriousness of the violation, including whether it was deliberate, reckless or negligent;\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe consequence and impact of the violation, including the extent of unfair enrichment of the violator, loss caused or likely to be caused;\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe conduct of the violator after the occurrence of the violation; and\\n\\n4. Prior violations or offences committed by the person.\\n\\n55\\n\\n9.\\n\\nREGULATORY\\tFRAMEWORK\\n\\nThe regulation and supervision of the financial system in India is carried out by different regulatory authorities. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates and supervises the major part of the financial system. The supervisory role of the RBI covers commercial banks, urban cooperative banks (UCBs), some financial institutions and non- banking finance companies (NBFCs). Some of the financial institutions, in turn, regulate or supervise other institutions in the financial sector, for instance, Regional Rural Banks and the Co-operative banks are supervised by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD); and housing finance companies by National Housing Bank(NHB). Department of Company Affairs (DCA), Government of India regulates deposit taking activities of corporate, other than NBFCS registered under companies Act, but not those which are under separate statutes. The Registrar of Cooperatives of different states in the case of single state cooperatives and the Central Government in the case of multi-state cooperatives are joint regulators, with the RBI for UCBs, and with NABARD for rural cooperatives. Whereas RBI and NABARD are concerned with the banking functions of the cooperatives, management control rests with the State/ Central Government. This “dual control” impacts the supervision and regulation of the cooperative banks. The capital market, mutual funds, and other capital market intermediaries are regulated by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) regulates the insurance sector; and the Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the pension funds.\\n\\nIn India, the capital market is regulated by the Capital Markets Division of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The division is responsible for formulating the policies related to the orderly growth and development of the securities markets (i.e. share, debt and derivatives) as well as protecting the interest of the investors. In particular, it is responsible for (i) institutional reforms in the securities markets, (ii) building regulatory and market institutions, (iii) strengthening investor protection mechanism, and (iv) providing efficient legislative framework for securities markets, such as Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (SEBI Act, 1992); Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956; and the Depositories Act, 1996. The division administers these legislations and the rules framed thereunder.\\n\\nIndia has a legacy financial regulatory architecture. The present work allocation between RBI, SEBI, IRDA, PFRDA, and Forward Market\\n\\n56\\n\\nCommission (FMC) – was not designed; it has evolved over the years, with a sequence of piecemeal decisions responding to immediate pressures from time to time. Each regulator has their own rules on registration, code of conduct, commissions and fees to monitor the product providers and distributors. RBI, SEBI and IRDA have grievance redress procedures through sector financial Ombudsmen services.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is the regulatory authority established under the SEBI Act, 1992, in order to protect the interests of the investors in securities as well as promote the development of the capital market. It involves regulating the business in stock exchanges; supervising the working of stock brokers, share transfer agents, merchant bankers, underwriters, etc; as well as prohibiting unfair trade practices in the securities market. The following departments of SEBI take care of the activities in the secondary market:-\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket Intermediaries Regulation and Supervision Department (MIRSD) registration, monitoring, supervision, inspection, investor grievances and policy related issues of all market intermediaries in respect of all segments of the markets, such as equity, equity derivatives, debt and debt related derivatives.\\n\\nconcerned with\\n\\nthe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconcerned with Market Regulation Department formulation of new policies as well as supervising the functioning and operations (except relating to derivatives) of securities exchanges, their subsidiaries, and market institutions such as Clearing and settlement organizations and Depositories. Corporation Finance Department - deals with matters relating to Issuance and listing of securities, including initial and continuous listing requirements, corporate governance and accounting/ auditing standards, corporate restructuring through Takeovers / buy backs, Delisting etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestment Management department - responsible for registering and regulating mutual funds, venture capital funds, foreign venture capital investors, collective investment schemes, including plantation schemes, Foreign Institutional Investors, Portfolio Managers and Custodians.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe for Integrated Surveillance department - responsible monitoring market activity through market systems, data from other departments and analytical software.\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\n\\nInvestigations Department (IVD) - responsible for conducting investigations on potentially illegal market activities, providing referrals to the enforcement department and assisting the enforcement department in enforcing SEBI action against violators.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnforcement Department (ED) - responsible for proceedings related to regulatory action and obtaining redress for violations of securities laws and regulations against all market participants, issuers and individuals and other entities that breach securities laws and regulations.\\n\\n\\n\\nDepartment of Legal Affairs (LAD) - responsible to provide legal counsel to the Board and to its other departments, and to handle non-enforcement litigation.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnquiries and Adjudication Department (EAD) - handle quasi judicial matters and provide initiate adjudication brought by the other Departments against alleged violators who are within SEBI’s disciplinary jurisdiction.\\n\\ntimely hearings and\\n\\n\\n\\nOffice of Investor Assistance and Education (OIAE) - support SEBI’s operations by handling investor complaints centrally and be the focal point of SEBI’s investor education effort. The Office would be the single point interface with investors and would receive complaints relating to all departments, forward to the concerned departments, follow up and respond to investors.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral Serviced Department (GSD) - support all of the internal operations of SEBI.\\n\\n\\n\\nDepartment of Economic and Policy Analysis (DEPA) - maintain the data base for entire capital/ securities market, prepare weekly and monthly report to be sent to Ministry of Finance, prepare papers on regulatory developments or changes in regulatory structures, provide research based input for policy formation by operational departments or senior management,\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation Technology Department - perform its role as the technical support group for SEBI.\\n\\nThe Governing Board of the stock exchange consists of elected member directors, government nominees and public representatives. Rules, byelaws and regulations of the stock exchange provide substantial powers to the Executive Director for maintaining efficient and smooth day-to-day functioning of the stock exchange. The governing Board has the responsibility to orderly maintain the well-regulated market.\\n\\n58\\n\\n10.\\t LAWS\\tAPPLICABLE\\tTO\\tFINANCIAL\\tMARKET\\n\\nVarious acts, rules, regulations, ordinances, guidelines, clarifications and press releases constitute the legal framework of Indian financial market.

They are instruments for making payments and discharging business obligations.\\n\\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does not define a negotiable instrument but merely states, “a negotiable instrument means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or bearer.” (Section 13)\\n\\nIn simple words, negotiable means transferable and instrument means document.\\n\\nThus, the term, negotiable instrument means a written document which creates a right in favour of some person and which is freely transferable. Although the Act mentions only these three instruments\\n\\n62\\n\\n(such as a promissory note, a bill of exchange and cheque), it does not exclude the possibility of adding any other instrument which satisfies the following two conditions of negotiability:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe instrument should be freely transferable (by delivery or by endorsement. and delivery) by the custom of the trade. Usually, when we transfer any property to somebody, we are required to make a transfer deed, get it registered, pay stamp duty, etc. But, such formalities are not required while transferring a negotiable instrument. The ownership is changed by mere delivery (when payable to the bearer) or by valid endorsement and delivery (when payable to order). Further, while transferring it is also not required to give a notice to the previous holder.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe person who obtains it in good faith and for value should get it free from all defects, and be entitled to recover the money of the instrument in his own name. This means that a person who receives a negotiable instrument has a clear and undisputable title to the instrument. However, the title of the receiver will be absolute, only if he has got the instrument in good faith and for a consideration.\\n\\nAbout\\tthe\\tAct\\n\\nIt is an Act to define and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques.\\n\\nThe Negotiable Instruments Act was enacted, in India, in 1881 and came into force on the 1st day of March, 1882. Prior to its enactment, the provision of the English Negotiable Instrument Act were applicable in India, and the present Act is also based on the English Act with certain modifications. It extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nThe main object of the Negotiable Instruments Act is to legalise the system by which instruments contemplated by it could pass from hand to hand by negotiation like any other goods. The purpose of the Act was to present an orderly and authoritative statement of leading rules of law relating to the negotiable instruments To achieve the objective of the Act, the Legislature thought it proper to make provision in the Act for conferring certain privileges to the mercantile instruments contemplated under it and provide special procedure in case the obligation under the instrument was not discharged.\\n\\n63\\n\\nTypes of Negotiable Instruments\\n\\nNegotiable instruments recognised by the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nPromissory notes\\n\\n(ii) Bills of exchange\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nCheques.\\n\\nNegotiable instruments recognised by usage or custom are: (i) Hundis (ii) Share warrants (iii) Dividend warrants (iv) Bankers draft (v) Circular notes (vi) Bearer debentures (vii) Debentures of Bombay Port Trust (viii) Railway receipts (ix) Delivery orders.\\n\\nA “promissory note” is an instrument in writing (not being a bank-note or a currency-note) containing an unconditional under¬taking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument. (Sec.4 of NI Act, 1881)\\n\\n“A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the instrument”. (Sec.5 of NI Act, 1881)\\n\\nSec.6 of the NI Act, 1881 defines a cheque as a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand and it includes the electronic image of a truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic form.\\n\\n10.2.\\t Reserve\\tBank\\tof\\tIndia\\tAct,\\t1934\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (II of 1934) provides the statutory basis of the functioning of the Reserve Bank, which commenced operations on April 1, 1935.\\n\\nIncorporation,\\tcapital\\tand\\tmanagement\\n\\nReserve Bank of India has been constituted for the purposes of taking over the management of the currency from the Central Government and of carrying on the business of banking in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

Section 12 of Chapter five deals with registration of\\n\\n85\\n\\nstock brokers, sub-brokers, share transfer agents, etc. No depository, participant, custodian of securities, foreign institutional investor, credit rating agency or any other intermediary associated with the securities market as the Board may by notification in this behalf specify, shall buy or sell or deal in securities except under and in accordance with the conditions of a certificate of registration obtained from the Board in accordance with the regulations made under this Act.\\n\\nProhibition of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices, Insider Trading and Substantial Acquisition Of Securities Or Control\\n\\nProhibition of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices, Insider Trading and Substantial Acquisition of Securities or Control is covered under Chapter VA of the SEBI Act.\\n\\nNo\\tperson\\tshall\\tdirectly\\tor\\tindirectly-\\n\\ni.\\n\\nuse or employ, in connection with the issue, purchase or sale of any securities listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\\n\\nii.\\n\\nemploy any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with issue or dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange; engage in any act, practice, course of business which operates or would operate as fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the issue, dealing in securities which are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange, in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\\n\\niii.\\n\\nengage in insider trading;\\n\\niv.\\n\\ndeal in securities while in possession of material or non-public information or communicate such material or non-public information to any other person, in a manner which is in contravention of the provisions of this Act or the rules or the regulations made thereunder;\\n\\nv.\\n\\nacquire control of any company or securities more than the percentage of equity share capital of a company whose securities are listed or proposed to be listed on a recognised stock exchange in contravention of the regulations made under this Act.\\n\\n86\\n\\nEstablishment,\\tJurisdiction,\\tAuthority\\tand\\tProcedure\\tof\\tAppellate\\t Tribunal\\n\\nEstablishment, jurisdiction, authority and procedure of appellate tribunal has been covered under chapter VIB. The Securities Appellate Tribunal has been established under section 15K of the Act. The Central Government shall, by notification, establish one or more Appellate Tribunals to be known as the Securities Appellate Tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction, powers and authority conferred on such Tribunal by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force. The Central Government shall also specify in the notification the matters and places in relation to which the Securities Appellate Tribunal may exercise jurisdiction.\\n\\nAny person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal to him on any question of law arising out of such order.\\n\\n10.6.\\t Recovery\\t of\\t Debts\\t Due\\t to\\t Banks\\t and\\t Financial\\t Institutions\\tAct,\\t1993\\n\\nThe Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (RDBFI Act) was passed by the Parliament of India to provide for the speedy adjudication of matters relating to recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions. This Act provided a procedure that was distinct from the existing Code of Civil Procedure in order to ensure such a speedy adjudication. This Act also provided for setting up of a separate set of tribunals to hear such matters and these tribunals are termed as Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs). The Government has set up such DRTs in many states in the country. Presently there are thirty three Debt Recovery Tribunals and five Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals across the country.\\n\\nThe provisions of RDDBI Act, 1993 will not apply where the amount of debt due to any bank or financial institution or to a consortium of banks or financial institutions is less than ten lakh rupees or such other amount, being not less than one lakh rupees.\\n\\nThe RDDBI Act, 1993 provides Banks and Financial Institutions to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal by filing an application for recovering its due. Only when the amount of due qualifies under the Act,\\n\\n87\\n\\nthe Banks and Financial Institutions could approach the Debt Recovery Tribunals under RDDBI Act, 1993. When the Bank approaches the Tribunal for recovery, then, the Tribunal will look into the claim made by the Bank in accordance with the procedure prescribed under RDDBI Act, 1993 and finally pass an award. The award can be executed by the Bank.\\n\\nThe procedures adopted in DRTs are very simple and uncomplicated. Unlike higher costs in civil courts, the DRT proceedings are cheaper. Within 30 days of filing DRT application, summons are sent to the defendants, who have to immediately submit their reply statements. Evidences are admitted in the form of sworn affidavit. Defendants are given the opportunity to cross examine bank’s witness. As per the Act, the Tribunal has to decide the case within six months from the filing of case.\\n\\nAny person aggrieved by any measure taken by secured creditor or his authorized officer may file an appeal to Debts Recovery Tribunal, within 45 days from date on which such measure was taken i.e. action of taking possession of asset, takeover of management of business of borrower, appointing person to manage secured asset etc. is taken by the creditor.\\n\\nWhen a borrower files an appeal, the appeal cannot be entertained unless; the borrower deposits 75% of the amount claimed in the notice by secured creditor. The DRT can waive or reduce the amount required to be deposited. The amount is not required to be deposited at the time of filing appeal, but appeal will not be heard till the amount is deposited. The borrower while filing the appeal should also file an application requesting the Debt Recovery Tribunal to admit the appeal without deposit of any amount. It the DRT orders partial deposit of the amount and the same is not deposited, appeal can be dismissed. The 75% deposit is only required if the appeal is filed by the borrower. If some other aggrieved person (e.g. guarantor, shareholder) files it the deposit is not required.\\n\\nIf a person is aggrieved by the order of the DRT, it can file an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal within 30 days from date of receipt of the DRT order.\\n\\nIf the DRT or Appellate Tribunal holds that possession of assets by the secured creditor was wrongful and directs the secured creditor to return asset to concerned borrower, the borrower shall be entitled to\\n\\n88\\n\\ncompensation and costs as may be determined by DRT or Appellate tribunal.\\n\\nThe Tribunal can also direct return of asset, if the secured creditor had already sold or transferred the asset to a third party.\\n\\nThe tribunal can also make an interim order (injunction or stay or attachment) against the defendant to debar him from transferring, alienating or disposing of any property and assets belonging to him. In the case of disobedience of an order made by the Tribunal, or breach of any of the terms on which the order was made the Tribunal may order the properties of the person guilty of such disobedience or breach, to be attached and may also order such person to be detained in the civil prison.\\n\\nThe Tribunal has the power to appoint a receiver of any property, to remove any person from the possession or custody of the property and commit the same to the possession, custody or management of the receiver for the realization, management, protection, preservation and improvement of the property, the collection of the rents and profits thereof, the application and disposal of such rents and profits and the execution of documents as the owner himself has, or can appoint a Commissioner for preparation of an inventory of the properties of the defendant or for the sale thereof.\\n\\n10.7.\\t Depositories\\tAct,\\t1996\\n\\nThe Depositories Act, 1996 provides a legal framework for establishment of depositories to facilitate holding of securities including shares in the demat form (electronic form) and to effect transfer of securities through book entry. The Act establishes the depository system in India by providing for setting up of one or more depositories to enable the investors to hold securities in non-physical form (known as dematerialized form) and to affect transfer of securities by way of book entries in accounts maintained by the depository.\\n\\n“Depository” means a company formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), and which has been granted a certificate of registration under sub-section (1A) of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992). (Sec.2(1)(e) of Depositories Act, 1996)\\n\\n89\\n\\nThe depository system envisages a deposit of securities by various investors with the depository. Once the securities are lodged with the depository, their transfer would be through book entry transfers in accounts maintained by the depository. Thus the main function of a depository is to dematerialize the securities and enable their transaction in book entry form.\\n\\nEvery depository is required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and will have to obtain a Certificate for commencement of business on fulfillment of the prescribed conditions.\\n\\nRights\\tand\\tobligations\\tof\\tDepositories,\\tParticipants,\\tIssuers\\tand\\t Beneficial\\tOwners\\tare\\tgiven\\tbelow:\\n\\n1.

The depository, thereafter will enter the name of that person in its records, as the beneficial owner (Sec. 6).\\n\\n4. Registration of Transfer of Securities with Depository:\\n\\nEvery depository shall, on receipt of intimation from a participant, register the transfer of security in the name of the transferee. Further, if a beneficial owner or a transferee of any security seeks to have custody of such security, the depository shall inform the issuer accordingly (Sec. 7).\\n\\n5.

Option to opt out in Respect of any Security:\\n\\nIf a beneficial owner seeks to opt out of a depository in respect of any security, he shall inform the depository accordingly who will make appropriate entries in its records and shall inform the issuer (Sec. 14).\\n\\n12. Depositories to Indemnify Loss in Certain Cases:\\n\\n91\\n\\nThe depository shall have to indemnify any loss caused to the beneficial owner due to its negligence or of the participant. Where the loss due to the negligence of the participant is indemnified by the depository, the depository shall have the right to recover the same from such participant.\\n\\nPenalties\\n\\nIf any issuer or its agent or any person, who is registered as an intermediary under the provisions of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, fails to dematerialise or issue the certificate of securities on opting out of a depository by the investors, within the time specified under this Act or regulations or bye-laws made thereunder or abets in delaying the process of dematerialisation or issue the certificate of securities on opting out of a depository of securities, such issuer or its agent or intermediary shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less.\\n\\nIf any depository or participant or any issuer or its agent or any person, who is registered as an intermediary under the provisions of section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, after having been called upon by the Board in writing, to redress the grievances of the investors, fails to redress such grievances within the time specified by the Board, such depository or participant or issuer or its agents or intermediary shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less.\\n\\nWithout prejudice to any award of penalty by the adjudicating officer under this Act, if any person contravenes or attempts to contravene or abets the contravention of the provisions of this Act or of any rules or regulations or bye-laws made thereunder, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees, or with both.\\n\\nIf any person fails to pay the penalty imposed by the adjudicating officer or fails to comply with any of his directions or orders, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month but which may extend to ten years, or with fine, which may extend to twenty-five crore rupees, or with both.\\n\\n92\\n\\n10.8.\\t Foreign\\tExchange\\tManagement\\tAct,\\t1999\\n\\nExchange Control in India dates back to 1939 when for the first time it was introduced as a war measure under the Defence of India Rules. Soon after independence, a complex web of controls were imposed for all external transactions through a legislation i.e., Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947. These were put into a more rigorous framework of controls through FERA, 1973. Severe restrictions on current account transactions had continued till mid-1990s when relaxations were made in the operations of the FERA, 1973. The control framework was essentially transaction based in terms of which all transactions in foreign exchange including those between residents and non-residents were prohibited, unless specifically permitted.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, consistent with the general philosophy of economic reforms a sea change relating to the broad approach to reform in the external sector took place. The Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments (Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan, 1993) set the broad agenda in this regard. The Committee recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a market-determined exchange rate regime within limits; liberalisation of current account transactions leading to current account convertibility; compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to non debt creating flows; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings, especially short-term debt; discouraging volatile elements of flows from non-resident Indians; full freedom for outflows associated with inflows (i.e., principal, interest, dividend, profit and sale proceeds) and gradual liberalisation of other outflows; and dissociation of Government in the intermediation of flow of external assistance, as in the 1980s, receipts on capital account and external financing were confined to external assistance through multilateral and bilateral sources.\\n\\nThe sequence of events in the subsequent years generally followed these recommendations. In 1993, exchange rate of rupee was made market determined; close on the heels of this important step, India accepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund in August 1994 and adopted the current account convertibility.\\n\\nIn 1997, the Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility (CAC), constituted by the Reserve Bank, had indicated the preconditions for Capital Account Convertibility. The three crucial preconditions were fiscal consolidation, a mandated inflation target and, strengthening of the financial system. The Tarapore Committee had also recommended\\n\\n93\\n\\nchange in the legislative framework governing foreign exchange transactions. Accordingly, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) which formed the statutory basis for exchange control in India was repealed and replaced by the new Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) with effect from June 2000. The philosophical approach was shifted from that of conservation of foreign exchange to one of facilitating trade and payments as well as developing orderly foreign exchange market.\\n\\nThe main objective of the Act is to facilitate external trade and payments and to promote the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. It is the main legislation that deals with inbound investments into India and outbound investments from India and trade and business between India and the other countries.\\n\\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 came into force on 1st June 2000 vide Notification No.371(E) dated 01-05-2000.\\n\\nApplicability\\n\\nThe Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 is applicable to all parts of India i.e. it applies to any transaction that takes place in India by any person residing in India at the time of transaction. It also applies to all branches, offices and agencies outside India owned or controlled by a person who is resident of India. Any contravention that is committed outside India by these entities, is also covered under FEMA.\\n\\nResidential status is the most important factor for determining the applicability of the Act. The types of persons that are covered under the Act are –\\n\\n\\n\\nPersons resident in India\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-resident Indian (NRI)\\n\\n\\n\\nPersons resident outside India\\n\\n\\n\\nOverseas Corporate Body (OCB)\\n\\nPersons\\tof\\tIndian\\tOrigin\\t(PIO)\\n\\nRegulation and Management of Foreign Exchange\\n\\nThe basic provisions of the Act are dealt with under Chapter II, i.e. regulation and management of Foreign Exchange.\\n\\n94\\n\\nNo person should deal in foreign exchange except through an authorized person. The Act lays down restrictions on dealings in foreign exchange and provides that:\\n\\n\\n\\nNo person should deal in or transfer foreign exchange or foreign security to any person who is not an authorized person.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo person should make any payment or credit to any person outside India.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo person should receive any payment from or on behalf of any person resident outside India otherwise through an authorized person.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo person should enter into any financial transaction in India as consideration for or in association with acquisition or creation or transfer of a right to acquire, any asset outside India by any person.\\n\\nNo person resident in India should acquire, hold, own, possess or transfer any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India.\\n\\nAny person resident in India is restrained from acquiring, holding, owning, possessing or transferring any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India.\\n\\nAny person can sell or draw foreign exchange to or from an authorized person if such sale or drawal is a current account transaction.\\n\\nAny person can draw or sell foreign exchange from or to an authorized person for a capital account transaction. The Reserve Bank of India may permit any class or classes of capital account transactions and also lay down the limit upto which foreign exchange may be admissible for capital account transactions. But RBI should not impose any restriction on the drawal of foreign exchange for payments due on account of amortization of loans or for depreciation of direct investments in the ordinary course of business.\\n\\nThe\\tReserve\\tBank\\tof\\tIndia\\tcan\\tprohibit,\\trestrict\\tor\\tregulate\\tby\\t regulations,\\tthe\\ttransactions\\tspecified\\tbelow:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\ntransfer or issue of any foreign security by a person resident in India;\\n\\n(b)\\n\\ntransfer or issue of any security by a person resident outside\\n\\n95\\n\\nIndia;\\n\\n(c)\\n\\ntransfer or issue of any security or foreign security by any branch, office or agency in India of a person resident outside India;\\n\\n(d) any borrowing or lending in foreign exchange in whatever form or\\n\\nby whatever name called;\\n\\n(e) any borrowing or lending in rupees in whatever form or by whatever name called between a person resident in India and a person resident outside India;\\n\\n(f)\\n\\ndeposits between persons resident in India and persons resident outside India;\\n\\n(g) export, import or holding of currency or currency notes;\\n\\n(h)\\n\\ntransfer of immovable property outside India, other than a lease not exceeding five years, by a person resident in India;\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nacquisition or transfer of immovable property in India, other than a lease not exceeding five years, by a person resident outside India;\\n\\n(j)\\n\\ngiving of a guarantee or surety in respect of any debt, obligation or other liability incurred—\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nby a person resident in India and owed to a person resident outside India; or\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nby a person resident outside India.\\n\\nThe Act allows a person resident in India to hold, own, transfer or invest in foreign currency, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India if the same was transacted when he was resident outside India or inherited from a person who was resident outside India. The Act also allows a person resident outside India to hold, own, transfer or invest in Indian currency, etc. situated in India if the same was transacted by him when he was resident in India or inherited from a person who was resident in India.\\n\\nExport of goods and services is also covered under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. Every exporter of goods and services should submit to the Reserve Bank or other specified authority a declaration containing true and correct material particulars, including the amount representing the full export value or, if the full export value of the goods is not ascertainable at the time of export, the value which the exporter, having regard to the prevailing market conditions, expects to receive on the sale of the goods/services in a market outside India.\\n\\n96\\n\\nThe Act fixes a responsibility on persons resident in India who have any amount of foreign exchange due or accrued in their favour to get the same realized and repatriated to India within the period and manner specified by RBI.\\n\\nSection\\t 46\\t of\\t the\\t Foreign\\t Exchange\\t Management\\t Act,\\t 1999\\t empowers\\tthe\\tCentral\\tGovernment\\tto\\tmake\\trules\\tto\\tcarry\\tout\\tthe\\t provisions\\tof\\tthe\\tAct.\\tThe\\trules\\tcan\\tbe\\tmade\\tfor\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\na)\\n\\nImposition of reasonable restrictions on current account transactions;\\n\\nb) Manner in which the contravention may be compounded;\\n\\nc) Manner of holding an inquiry by the Adjudicating Authorities\\n\\nd)\\n\\nForm of appeal and fee for filing such appeal;\\n\\ne)\\n\\nSalary and allowances payable to and the other terms and conditions of service of the Chairperson and other Members of the Appellate Tribunal and the Special Director (Appeals);\\n\\nf)\\n\\nSalaries and allowances and other conditions of service of the officers and employees of the Appellate Tribunal and the Office of the Special Director (Appeals);\\n\\ng)\\n\\nAdditional matters in respect of which the Appellate Tribunal and the Special Director (Appeals) may exercise the powers of a civil court;\\n\\nh)\\n\\nThe authority or person and the manner in which any documents may be authenticated; and\\n\\ni)\\n\\nAny other matter which is required to be, or may be prescribed.\\n\\nSection\\t 47\\t of\\t the\\t Foreign\\t Exchange\\t Management\\t Act,\\t 1999\\t empowers\\tthe\\tReserve\\tBank\\tof\\tIndia\\tto\\tmake\\tregulations\\tto\\tcarry\\t out\\tthe\\tprovisions\\tof\\tthe\\tAct\\tand\\tRules\\tmade\\tthereunder.\\tThe\\t regulations\\tcan\\tbe\\tmade\\tfor\\tthe\\tfollowing:\\n\\na)\\n\\nThe permissible classes of capital account transactions, the limits of admissibility of foreign exchange for such transactions, and the prohibition, restriction or regulation of certain capital account transactions;\\n\\nb)\\n\\nThe manner and the form in which the declaration is to be furnished by exporters;\\n\\nc)\\n\\nThe period within which and the manner of repatriation of foreign exchange;\\n\\n97\\n\\nd)\\n\\nThe limit up to which any person may possess foreign currency or foreign coins;\\n\\ne)\\n\\nThe class of persons and the limit up to which foreign currency account may be held or operated;\\n\\nf)\\n\\nThe limit up to which foreign exchange acquired may be exempted;\\n\\ng)\\n\\nThe limit up to which foreign exchange acquired may be retained;\\n\\nh)\\n\\nAny other matter which is required to be, or may be, specified.\\n\\n10.9.\\t SARFAESI\\tAct,\\t2002\\n\\nThe Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (here-in-after referred to as The Securitisation Act) has been enacted with an intention to strengthen the creditors rights through foreclosure and enforcement of securities by the banks and financial institutions by conferring on the creditors the right to seize the secured asset and sell of the same in order to recover dues promptly bypassing the costly and very time consuming legal process through courts.\\n\\nThe Securitisation Act empowers the banks and financial institutions to move on its own against a borrower whose assets are secured, and who has made some kind of default in repayment of the same. The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law . Thus after complying with the statutory provisions in the said act the banks can:\\n\\n\\n\\nTake possession of the secured assets of the borrower. This includes the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the same for realization of the secured debt.\\n\\n\\n\\nTake over the management of the secured asset including the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale of the same for realization of the secured debt.\\n\\n\\n\\nAppoint any person to manage the secured asset.\\n\\nThe\\tAct\\tdeals\\twith\\tthree\\taspects.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnforcement of Security Interest by secured creditor (Banks/\\n\\n98\\n\\nFinancial Institutions)\\n\\n\\n\\nTransfer of non- performing assets to Asset Reconstruction Company, which will then dispose of those assets and realize the proceeds.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo provide a legal framework for securitisation of assets.\\n\\nIncorporation\\tand\\tregistration\\tof\\tSpecial\\tPurpose\\tCompanies\\t-\\n\\nThe Securitisation Act proposes to securitise and reconstruct the financial assets through two special purpose vehicles viz. ‘Securitisation Company (‘SCO’)’ and ‘Reconstruction Company (RCO)’. SCO and RCO ought to be a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 having securitisation and asset reconstruction respectively as main object. The Securitisation Act requires compulsory registration of SCO and RCO under the Securitisation Act before commencing its business. Further a minimum financial stability requirement is also provided by requiring SCO and RCO to possess owned fund of Rs.2 crore or up to 15% of the total financial assets acquired or to be acquired. The RBI has the power to specify the rate of owned fund from time to time. Different rates can be prescribed for different classes of SCO and RCO.\\n\\nEnforcement\\tof\\tSecurity\\tInterest\\t-\\n\\nUnder the Act security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of court or tribunal, by such creditor in accordance with the provision of this Act.\\n\\nWhere any borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security under a security agreement, makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any installment thereof , and his account in respect of such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non-performing asset, then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor with in sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of the rights under sub-section (4) of Sec.13.

Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has issued a set of directions to regulate the activities of NBFCs under its jurisdiction. Some features of the RBI regulatory framework are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\nAn NBFC must have specific authorization to accept deposits from the public.\\n\\n\\n\\nNBFC must display the Certificate of Registration or a certified copy thereof at the Registered office and other offices/branches.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegistration of an NBFC with the RBI merely authorizes it to conduct the business of NBFC. RBI does not guarantee the repayment of deposits accepted by NBFCs. NBFCs cannot use the name of the RBI in any manner while conducting their business.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe NBFC whose application for grant of Certificate of Registration (CoR) has been rejected or cancelled by the RBI is neither authorized to accept fresh deposits nor renew existing deposit. Such rejection or cancellation is also published in newspapers from time to time. Besides, a list of NBFCs permitted to accept public deposits, NBFCs whose applications for CoR has been rejected or whose CoR has been cancelled by the RBI is available on the RBI’s web site www.rbi.org.in (go to site map and then NBFC list)\\n\\n\\n\\nNBFCs which accept deposits should have minimum investment grade credit rating granted by an approved credit rating agency for deposit collection, except certain Asset Finance (equipment leasing and hire purchase finance) companies and Residuary Non-Banking Companies (RNBCs).\\n\\n\\n\\nNBFCs excluding RNBCs cannot\\n\\n140\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffer a rate of interest on deposits more than that approved by RBI from time to time (current Interest Rate is 12.5%p.a)\\n\\n\\n\\nAccept deposit for a period less than 12 months and more than 60 months\\n\\n\\n\\nOffer any gifts/incentives to solicit deposits from public.\\n\\nRNBCs should\\n\\n\\n\\noffer a rate of interest of not less than 5% per annum on term deposits and 3.5% on daily deposits, both compounded annually, under extant directions.\\n\\n\\n\\nRNBCs cannot accept deposits for a period less than 12 months and more than 84 months.\\n\\n\\n\\nRNBCs cannot offer any gifts/incentives to solicit deposits from public\\n\\nNBFCs including RNBCs can\\n\\n\\n\\naccept deposit only against issue of proper receipt.\\n\\n\\n\\nthe receipt should bear the name of the company and should be signed by an authorized official of the company.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe receipt should mention the name of the depositor, the amount in words as well as figures, the rate of interest payable on the deposit amount and the date of repayment of matured deposit along with the maturity amount.\\n\\nIn the case of brokers/agents etc collecting public deposits on behalf of NBFCs, the depositors should satisfy themselves that the brokers/agents are duly authorized by the NBFC.\\n\\nIf a deposit taking NBFC fails to repay the deposit or the interest accrued thereon in accordance with the terms and conditions of acceptance of such deposit, redressal of grievance can be through - the Regional Bench of the Company Law Board at Chennai/ Delhi/ Kolkata/Mumbai\\n\\nAcceptance of deposits by companies engaged in activities including plantation activities, commodities trading, multilevel marketing, manufacturing activities, housing finance, nidhis (mutual benefit financial companies), and potential nidhis (mutual benefit company) and companies engaged in collective investment schemes do not come under the purview/regulations of the RBI.\\n\\nIndividuals, firms and other unincorporated association of\\n\\n141\\n\\nindividuals or bodies shall not accept deposits from the public–\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nif his or its business wholly or partly includes any of the financial activities such as loans and advances, acquisition of shares or marketable securities, leasing or hire purchase activities , or\\n\\nif his or its principal business is that of receiving deposits or lending in any manner.\\n\\n142\\n\\n12.\\n\\nINSURANCE\\n\\nInsurance is a contract whereby, in return for the payment of premium by the insured, the insurers pay the financial losses suffered by the insured as a result of the occurrence of unforeseen events. With the help of Insurance, large number of people exposed to similar risks makes contributions to a common fund out of which the losses suffered by the unfortunate few, due to accidental events, are made good.\\n\\nAn insurer is a company selling the insurance; an insured or policyholder is the person or entity buying the insurance. The insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage, called the premium.\\n\\nInsurance business is divided into following types of business namely:\\n\\n1)\\n\\nLife Insurance, and\\n\\n2) General Insurance\\n\\na. Marine insurance\\n\\nb.\\n\\nFire insurance\\n\\nc. Motor vehicle insurance\\n\\nd. Miscellaneous insurance\\n\\n3)\\n\\nReinsurance\\n\\nLife Insurance\\n\\nLife insurance is a contract that pledges payment of an amount to the person assured (or his nominee) on the happening of the event insured against. The contract is valid for payment of the insured amount during:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe date of maturity, or\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecified dates at periodic intervals, or\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunate death, if it occurs earlier.\\n\\nAmong other things, the contract also provides for the payment of premium periodically to the Corporation by the policyholder. Life insurance is universally acknowledged to be an institution, which eliminates ‘risk’, substituting certainty for uncertainty and comes to the timely aid of the family in the unfortunate event of death of the breadwinner.\\n\\n143\\n\\nGeneral\\tInsurance\\n\\nInsurance other than ‘Life Insurance’ falls under the category of General Insurance. General Insurance comprises of insurance of property against fire, burglary etc, personal insurance such as Accident and Health Insurance, and liability insurance which covers legal liabilities.\\n\\nNon-life insurance companies have products that cover property against Fire and allied perils, flood storm and inundation, earthquake and so on. There are products that cover property against burglary, theft etc. The non-life companies also offer policies covering machinery against breakdown. There are policies that cover the hull of ships and so on. A Marine Cargo policy covers goods in transit including by sea, air and road. Further, insurance of motor vehicles against damages and theft forms a major chunk of non-life insurance business.\\n\\nMicro\\tInsurance\\n\\nThe term Micro-insurance is used to refer to insurance to the low- income people, and is different from insurance in general as it is a low value product (involving modest premium and benefit package) which requires different design and distribution strategies such as premium based on community risk rating (as opposed to individual risk rating), active involvement of an intermediate agency representing the target community and so forth.\\n\\nIndia is the first country to introduce regulation for micro insurance, i.e. the IRDA (Micro-Insurance) Regulations, 2005 and it is one of the few developing countries in the world that has a special micro-insurance regulation to regulate the suppliers of micro-insurance products through its special agency for insurance regulation – the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority.\\n\\nA Micro-Insurance Policy means an Insurance Policy sold under a Plan which has been specifically approved by the IRDA as a Micro-Insurance product.\\n\\nInsurance\\tLaws\\n\\nThe principal legislation regulating the insurance business in India is the Insurance Act of 1938. Some other existing legislations in the field are – the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) Act, 1956, the Marine Insurance Act, 1963, the General Insurance Business (GIB) (Nationalization) Act,\\n\\n144\\n\\n1972 and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act, 1999. The provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 are applicable to the contracts of insurance, whether for life or non-life. Similarly, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 are applicable to the companies carrying on insurance business. The subordinate legislation includes Insurance Rules, 1939 and the Ombudsman Rules, 1998 framed by the Central Government under Sec.114 of the principal Act as also 32 regulations made by the IRDA under Sec.114 A of the principal Act and Sec.26 of the IRDA Act 1999.\\n\\nThe\\tInsurance\\tsector\\tin\\tIndia\\tis\\tregulated\\tby\\tthe\\tfollowing\\tActs:\\t 1)\\n\\nThe Insurance Act, 1938\\n\\n2)\\n\\nThe Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956\\n\\n3) Marine Insurance Act, 1963\\n\\n4) General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972\\n\\n5)\\n\\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) Act, 1999\\n\\nRegulations\\t framed\\t under\\t Development\\tAuthority\\t(IRDA)\\tAct,\\t1999\\tare:\\n\\nthe\\n\\nInsurance\\t Regulatory\\t and\\n\\n1)\\n\\nIRDA (Member of Insurance Advisory Committee) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n2)\\n\\nIRDA Regulations, 2000\\n\\n(Appointment of\\n\\nInsurance Advisory Committee)\\n\\n3)\\n\\nIRDA (The Insurance Advisory Committee) (Meeting) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n4)\\n\\nIRDA (Appointed Actuary ) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n5)\\n\\nIRDA (Actuarial Report and Abstract) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n6)\\n\\nIRDA (Licensing of Insurance Agents) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n7)\\n\\nIRDA (Assets, Liabilities and Solvency Margin of Insurers) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n8)\\n\\nIRDA (General Insurance-Reinsurance) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n9)\\n\\nIRDA (Registration of Indian Insurance Companies) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n10)\\n\\nIRDA (Insurance Advertisements and Disclosure) Regulations, 2000\\n\\n145\\n\\n11)\\n\\n12)\\n\\n13)\\n\\n14)\\n\\n15)\\n\\n16)\\n\\n17)\\n\\n18)\\n\\n19)\\n\\n20)\\n\\n21)\\n\\n22)\\n\\n23)\\n\\n24)\\n\\n25)\\n\\n26)\\n\\n27)\\n\\n28)\\n\\n29)\\n\\n30)\\n\\n31)\\n\\n32)\\n\\nIRDA (Meetings) Regulations, 2000\\n\\nIRDA (Investment) Regulations, 2000\\n\\nIRDA (Conditions of Service of Officers and other Employees) Regulations, 2000\\n\\nIRDA (Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors (Licensing, Professional Requirements and Code of Conduct)) Regulations, 2000\\n\\nIRDA (Life Insurance - Reinsurance) Regulations, 2000\\n\\nIRDA (Third Party Administrators - Health Services) Regulations, 2001\\n\\nIRDA (Re-Insurance Advisory Committee) Regulations, 2001\\n\\nIRDA (Preparation of Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report of Insurance Companies) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Insurance Brokers) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Obligations of Insurers to Rural and Social Sectors) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Licensing of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Manner of Receipt of Premium) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Distribution of Surplus) Regulations, 2002\\n\\nIRDA (Qualification of Actuary) Regulations, 2004\\n\\nIRDA (Micro-Insurance) Regulations, 2005\\n\\nIRDA (Maternity Leave) Regulations, 2005\\n\\nIRDA (Reinsurance Cessions) Notification\\n\\nIRDA (Sharing of Database for Distribution of Insurance Products) Regulations, 2010\\n\\nIRDA (Treatment of Discontinued Linked Insurance Policies) Regulations, 2010\\n\\nIRDA(Scheme for Amalgamation and Transfer of General Insurance Business) Regulations 2011\\n\\nIRDA(Issuance of Capital by Life Regulations, 2011\\n\\nInsurance Companies)\\n\\n146\\n\\nThe\\tInsurance\\tAct,\\t1938\\n\\nIt is the first comprehensive piece of insurance legislation in India governing both life and non life branches of insurance.\\n\\nThe Act applies to all type of insurance business-life, fire, marine etc. done by companies incorporated in India or elsewhere.\\n\\nAccording to Sec. 2(C) of the Act, there is prohibition of transaction of insurance business by certain persons.

FINANCIAL PLANNING\\n\\nA financial plan is a series of steps which are carried out, or goals that are accomplished, which relate to an individual’s financial affairs. It is a series of steps or specific goals undertaken for spending and saving future income. This plan allocates future income to various types of expenses and also reserves some income for short-term and long-term savings.\\n\\nThe importance of financial planning especially in the present scenario cannot be overstated. Among others, two factors are responsible for the same i.e. inflation and changing lifestyles. Inflation is a situation where too much money chases a limited number of goods. This leads to a fall in the value of money. It is also expressed as a rise in the general price level. Financial planning can ensure that one is equipped to deal with the impact of inflation, especially in phases like retirement when expenses continue but income streams dry up. The second factor is changing lifestyles. With higher disposable incomes, it is common for individuals to upgrade their standard of living. Apart from these, there are contingencies like medical emergencies or unplanned expenditure that an individual might have to cope with. Sound financial planning can enable him to easily mitigate such situations, without straining his finances.\\n\\nIt is possible to manage income effectively through financial planning. It helps in segregating it into tax payments, other monthly expenditures and savings. Financial planning is also necessary from the point of family security. The various policies available in the market serve the purpose of financially securing the family. The savings created through appropriate planning come to the rescue in difficult times. Death of the bread winner in a family, affects the standard of living to a great extent. A proper financial plan such as a Will, acts as a guard in such situations and enables the family to survive hard times.\\n\\nInvestment\\n\\nA person gets income as salary or wages, business profits, professional fees etc. Savings is nothing but the surplus available over the expenses. This surplus amount needs to be invested to ensure future returns. Investment can be in various schemes available in the financial market like deposits, mutual funds, insurance policies, pension schemes etc. One has to analyze the cost of investment over the other and then decide which will be appropriate and a better investment opportunity.\\n\\n148\\n\\nInvestment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or appreciate in the future. In finance, investment means the purchase of a financial product or other item of value with an expectation of favorable future returns.\\n\\nSmall\\tsavings\\tschemes\\tin\\tIndia\\n\\nSmall Saving schemes have been always an important source of household savings in India and they are essentially a basket of diversified and heterogeneous products. Although these instruments are technically not Government Securities and do not have any explicit Government guarantee, their legacy has given them characteristic of being equivalent to that of a Sovereign liability. These schemes have been extremely popular amongst a large number of small investors in India who seek to invest in a secure instrument. At the same time, these instruments have been treated as a means of providing social benefit to the small savers.\\n\\nThe Government formulates a basket of small savings schemes to meet the varying needs of different groups of small investors. In respect of each scheme, statutory rules are framed by the Central Government indicating the various details including the rate of interest and the maturity period.\\n\\nBeing liabilities of the Central Government, the schemes are perceived to be devoid of any risk and a surrogate for social security among the public.\\n\\nBroadly, three types of small saving schemes are currently in operation in India. These are postal deposits, saving certificates and social security schemes like PPF and retirement schemes.\\n\\nLegislations\\tregulating\\tinvestment\\tschemes\\tin\\tIndia\\n\\n1)\\n\\nThe Government Savings Banks Act, 1873\\n\\n2)\\n\\nThe Government Savings Certificates Act, 1959\\n\\n3)\\n\\nThe Post office Savings Banks (Nomination) Rules, 1960\\n\\n4)\\n\\nThe Post Office Savings Bank General Rules, 1981\\n\\n5)\\n\\nThe Post Office Savings Account Rules, 1981\\n\\n6)\\n\\nThe Post Office Recurring Deposit Rules, 1981\\n\\n149\\n\\n7)\\n\\nThe Post Office Time Deposit Rules, 1981\\n\\n8)\\n\\nNational Savings Scheme Rules, 1992\\n\\n9)\\n\\nPost Office (Monthly Income Account) Rules, 1987\\n\\n10)\\n\\nIndira Vikas Patra Rules, 1986\\n\\n11) National Savings Certificates (VIII Issue) Rules, 1989\\n\\n12) National Savings Certificates (IX Issue) Rules, 2011\\n\\n13) Provident Funds Act, 1925\\n\\n14) Public Provident Fund Act, 1968\\n\\n15) Public Provident Fund Scheme, 1968\\n\\n16) National Savings Scheme Rules, 1987\\n\\n17) The Post Office Savings Certificates Rules, 1960\\n\\n18) Senior Citizens Savings Scheme Rules, 2004\\n\\n19) Post Office Life Insurance Rules, 2011\\n\\n20) Kisan Vikas Patra Rules, 1988 (the scheme has been discontinued from 01/12/2011)\\n\\nPost\\tOffice\\tSchemes\\n\\nPost Offices offer varied services.
