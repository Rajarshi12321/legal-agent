It also needs to specify the relevant laws and attach supporting documents.\n",

The defendant doesn't have an automatic right to defend but must apply for leave to defend, showing a prima facie defense. If granted, the suit becomes an ordinary suit.  The court can grant summary judgment if the plaintiff has no real prospect of success or the defendant has no real prospect of a successful defense, and there's no compelling reason to delay.  The court can also impose conditions, costs, or dismiss the suit for non-compliance with orders.\n",
